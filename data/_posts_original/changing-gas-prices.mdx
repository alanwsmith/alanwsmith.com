To get into work each day I pass under I-95 at a fairly major
intersection. Like pretty much all such locations there are a bunch
of gas stations there. The standard mode of opperation is for them
to change their prices once or twice a week, but they don't do it
all at the same time. I've seen up to a 24 delay between the first
change and the last. Typically, I just drive till the light comes
on the dash telling me that I need to get more gas, but when I see
a price change where the stations are going up in price but haven't
all gotten there yet I fill up regardless of how much go juice I
have left in the tank. Just did this tonight. All the stations on
the block were at $2.41/gal. save for one which was still at
$2.33/gal. It's nice to feel like I saved at least a little.
