On Macs, there are two great hot-key combinations that can be used
for doing screen captures.

-   command + shift + 3 = full screen capture
-   command + shift + 4 = a partial screen capture based on a box
    you draw.

By default, when you make a grab with these commands the output
files are saved directly to your desktop. If you have a messy
desktop, they can be hard to find. Using a little command line
magic, you can change this output location to any directory you
choose. The command itself is:

defaults write com.apple.screencapture location
/output/path/directory

You would just need to change "/output/path/directory" to the
location where you want the screen grabs to go.

I got found this command on
[this page](http://macdevelopertips.com/defaults/change-screenshot-path.html)
from the [Mac Developer Tips](http://macdevelopertips.com/) site.
Just putting it here so that I can find it easier in case I ever
need it again.
