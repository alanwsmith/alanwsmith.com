The goal for the KSUID URL structure is so I can produce that contain unique IDs plus a descriptive slug based off the title which lets me change the title/slug without breaking link (thanks to automatic rewrites and redirects). TKTKTKTK Make a post about the KSUID setup

export const checklistData = [
    {
        title: "Setup KSUID urls, rewrites, and redirects",
        items: [
            'Add normalized ISO 8601 dates to all posts',
            'Add KSUID as "id" field in frontmatter to all posts sorted by date',
            'Add "updated" filed to frontmatter for all posts using same value as "date"',
            'Add "category: Miscellaneous" to frontmatter for any post that does not have a category field',
            
        ]
    }
]


TODO: finish the checklist and output it here

NOTE: There doesn't seem to be a way to add a specific date to the KSUID so that part won't be accurate but sorting by the post date will at least make the IDs sort in the proper order. That doesn't really matter, but since the date is involved, I want the sort to be accurate. This means I'll need to add at least a second between ID generation since that's the resolution KSUIDs work at.
