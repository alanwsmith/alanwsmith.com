Yep. Pretty much done streaming for a while. 

Going all VOD for [ThisIsHowYouProgram.com](http://thisishowyouprogram.com)

I was going to do the introduction, but I've been doing build out videos and just did a how-to. I've realized I want to do a little more of that in order to get a better sense of how things will go together before I do an intro video. 

I'm really liking this and I'm blown away by the idea of working on it for 20 years. 

I'm going to learn a boatload too.
