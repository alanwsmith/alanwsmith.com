Took another trip to Atlanta yesterday. Left my house about 6am and
made it back a little after midnight. Two flights, and several
hours of meetings make for a long ass day. It was almost a lot
longer. A couple hours before we left for the airport, it started
to snow.

Thankfully, we made it out. We were delayed about an hour and a
half, but managed to get past the de-icing line which would have
taken another two hours. I haven't seen snow in years, but I wasn't
too excited to see it. Worked out okay though.
