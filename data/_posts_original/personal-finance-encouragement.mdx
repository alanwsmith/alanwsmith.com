I've mentioned before that I really started paying attention to my
personal finance while I was in college. For several years now,
I've paid off my credit card every month and the only debt I have
is the mortgage on my house. I also put money in my 401K and in a
ROTH IRA every year. All that's to say that I'm doing a lot of
things right with my personal finances. One thing that has helped
me to stay on track with all of this is reading personal finance
books and blogs. In addition, I have recently started listening to
podcasts of the Dave Ramsey Show pod cast
([podcast](http://www.daveramsey.com/media/audio/podcast/podcast.xml)
- [site](http://www.daveramsey.com/)). Initially, I listened to the
show a few times just to see what it was like. Most of his focus is
on getting people out of debt so I wouldn't have thought that I
would keep tuning in. However, I find that it's generally really
encouraging to listen too. Basically, it helps re-enforce my goal
of saving money. I guess this shouldn't be surprising when you
consider how much of the time we are bombarded by both explicit and
implicit messages to spend every last dollar we have along with
some we don't via credit cards. An example of this encouragement is
my car. It's a 1995 Camry that has long sense been paid off. So, no
car payments and lower insurance. I'm probably going to get a new
one within the next year or so, but for as long as I've been at my
job (seven years now), I get occasional questions (and shit) from
folks about why I don't get a new one. If someone is just asking, I
just say that I like not having car payments. From the look I see
on peoples faces after this I'm guessing the pretty much always
start thinking about their car payment and how nice it would be to
not have to pay that out each month. If someone is being a shit, I
tend to drive the point home a little more by asking them what
their car payment each month is. The math of getting and staying
out of debt and then building wealth is pretty easy, but the
fortitude to do it can take a lot of energy. Especially if you are
just getting started. The show and a few blogs I read, like
[Get Rich Slowly](http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/) and
[The Simple Dollar](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/), really help
me recharge and stay on track.
