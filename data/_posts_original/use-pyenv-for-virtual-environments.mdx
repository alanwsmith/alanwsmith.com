NOTE: Not really using this since it requires setting up something in the shell that slows down the return of the command line each time

using the built in `venv` instead. from python3 that was installed by homebrew

OLD Notes:

Got notes from this article, it's basically how you did the setup. 

    https://medium.com/swlh/a-guide-to-python-virtual-environments-8af34aa106ac

Script to create new project they have is:

    mkdir $2 && cd $2 && pyenv local $1 && pyenv virtualenv venv-$2 && pyenv local venv-$2 && pyenv activate venv-$2
    
Where you pass a python version and a name to create the directory and project, of course, that doesn't deal with git

The manual way to do it is


    cd ~/git-repos
    git init --bare project_name
    cd ~/dev 
    git clone ~/git-dev/project_name
    cd project_name
    # add .gitignore
    # add README.md
    pyenv virtualenv 3.9.4 venv_project_name
    pyenv local venv_project_name
    
For PyCharm, just open the new directory, don't make a new project. 


    
Note sure if you need that first local since you're setting it to the venv later. 

    
    
    
Note, this is what's in the article, but I it look like you don't need the `pyenv local 3.9.0` or `pyenv activate venv_project_name` commands so you removed them above. 

    mkdir project_name
    cd project_name
    pyenv local 3.9.0
    pyenv virtualenv 3.9.0 venv_project_name
    pyenv local venv_project_name
    pyenv activate venv_project_name

tagging this with `pyvenv` in case you accidentally search for that.
