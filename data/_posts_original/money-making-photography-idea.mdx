Have a photographer at an Alabama Football game shooting digitally.
Setup a few Wi-Fi nodes to allow them to ship images automatically
to a partner with a printer outside the stadium. Have the partner
churn out 8x10s from the game. As soon as the final score come out,
print out a nice label. with the date, opponent, and final score.
Fame up the label and photo in a precut mat and sell them for $50 a
pop.  
You'd make a killing right up to the point when you got busted for
selling unlicensed photos.
