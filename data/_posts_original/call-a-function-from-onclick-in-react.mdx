This is an example of how to call a function from onClick in react to update the state of an item:

```jsx
const [pageFetchInProgress, setPageFetchInProgress] = React.useState(false)

<button onClick={() => setPageFetchInProgress(true)}>Check Status</button>
```

This is the fix for this which would start an infinite loop which react kills:

```jsx
<button onClick={setPageFetchInProgress(true)}>Check Status</button>
```
