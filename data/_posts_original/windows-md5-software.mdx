Lots of times when you download something from the internet you
might be given an "MD5" sum as well. It's a string of 32 characters
that can be letters or numbers and might looks something like this:
39b7b778a278b02be72b53e75c0225e2 The reason sites provide this is
to allow you to verify that the file you downloaded came in
properly and is complete and wasn't tampered with. If you have
windows and you want to verify an MD5 hash sum, you can install
[WinMD5Sum](http://www.download.com/WinMD5Sum/3000-2381_4-10115916.html?tag=lst-0-10)
This will add a new item when you right click on a file under the
"Send To" menu. If you send a file to WinMD5Sum it'll show you the
hash number. If it matches the one you got on the web site you
originally downloaded from you can be sure the file downloaded
exactly as expected.
