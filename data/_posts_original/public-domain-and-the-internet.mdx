Just found a link to [LibriVox](http://librivox.org/). From their
front page: "LibriVox provides free audiobooks from the public
domain". That's awesome. I'm a huge fan of audio books. In fact
over last Christmas I was talking with my mom about the way I learn
and the fact that I had a lot of "resource classes" when I was a
kid. Something I didn't know, but I don't guess should have
surprised me is that I am by default much more of an auditory
learner. With a lot of help I basically overcame this, but I still
don't read as fast as someone who processes the written word with
natural ease. When I read I basically have to "hear" the words in
my head so they go through the audio part of my brain. With audio
books, I don't have to expend the extra effort. The catalog at
LibriVox isn't that deep yet, but the first notable ones I saw
include: "Aesop's Fables", "Pride and Prejudice", and the
Gettysburg Address.
