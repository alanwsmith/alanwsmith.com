There are two languages that make web pages work - HTML and JavaScript. While attending the O'Reilly Fluent Conference<sup>1</sup>, I had the pleasure of meeting Brendan Eich<sup>2</sup>. He's the creator of JavaScript.

*Unfortunately, I was experimenting with the settings on my camera and borked this shot a little. Alas... such is life.*


I also met Ward Cunningham<sup>3</sup>. AKA the guy who created the first wiki, the forerunning of Wikipedia.

I feel smarter just for being in their proximity.

*Footnotes*

1. [Fluent 2012: JavaScript and Beyond](http://fluentconf.com/) - The conference was very well done. Congrats to O'Reilly for putting on a good show.
2. [Brendan Eich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) - Creator of JavaScript. Currently the CTO at Mozilla. My job would be boring without the language he created. 
3.[Ward Cunningham's Wikipedia Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham). Not at all surprising that they guy who created Wiki's has his own WikiPedia page.
