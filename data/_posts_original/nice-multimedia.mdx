There is a great little peice of functionality on the daughter
window player for this
[this mtvU peice](http://www.mtvu.com/on_mtvu/stand_in/cameron_diaz.jhtml).
Take a look at the resize abilities to the left of the
back|pause|forward control. You can either reduce the player, use
it in the default load, double the size of the video, or make it
full screen. It only works in IE and I'm guessing it will only work
on windows which sucks, but it's very well done. Kudos for keeping
the vidoe going during resizing. I'm not sure if this is built into
Flash or not, but it's a great example of their new video
abilities.
