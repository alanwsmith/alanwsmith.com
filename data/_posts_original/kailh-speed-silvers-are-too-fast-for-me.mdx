title: Kailh Speed Silvers Are Too Fast For Me
type: post

I picked up a [Moonlander Keyboard](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/). It's a lot of fun. One change I'd make, if I could do it again, is choosing different key switches. I went with [Kailh Speed Silvers](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/switches/index.php?switch=Kailh-Speed-Silver). I picked them based off [this chart](https://airtable.com/shr2beqjUXzTk6GfS/tblYLigKdFcOriJ1k?backgroundColor=orange&viewControls=on). They require super low pressure. Combined with the low key travel, I figured they'd be good for reducing the risk of RSI. 

Turns out, they're a little *too* easy to press. 

Breath on them wrong and they start throwing letters on the screen. I graze them all the time. Throwing unintentional letters in my words. After a few months of trying to get used to them, it's time to try something else. 

Down the keyboard switch rabbit hole I go.
