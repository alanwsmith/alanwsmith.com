Here's another shot of Dave with his eyes on fire. Not one of the
picks, but it shows the fire even higher. I should mention that I
shot this on IR film. I was using a strobe and everything in terms
of the exposure was a complete guess. I'm pretty sure I had never
shot infrared with a strobe before and I sure hadn't shot fire
before. The negs are pretty dense. I'd say over exposed by about
two stops. Three on some frames. If I had missed that far in my
guessing with digital it would not have been recoverable. Of
course, when you get virtually instant feedback with a histogram,
it only would have taken one or two test shots to dial in the
exposure.
