### Notes

More work on getting the transition script setup. Got the first version of it finished. All the Hugo short codes are being converted. 

Next up is just to determine if I want to rearrange the structure of the daily browsing files, stream notes, and journals as part of the move as well. After that, the content move will be all set. 

I want to start pulling in my Python scratch pad and nvAlt notes. First thigns first though. Get the site in a state where it can be published with the existing content.
