I'll confess to not remembering seeing a Fold-In from Mad magazine
when I was a kid. I'm sure I saw them on the occasions that I could
get my hands on one. This was a rare occurrence as the magazine was
frowned upon by my folks. Regardless, the N.Y. Times has an
[article up](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/arts/design/30genz.html?_r=1&oref=slogin&pagewanted=all)
on Al Jaffee. The guy who makes the Fold-Ins. The article is
interesting by itself, but make sure to check out
[the gallery](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/03/28/arts/20080330_FOLD_IN_FEATURE.html)
of Fold-Ins. These things are amazing.
