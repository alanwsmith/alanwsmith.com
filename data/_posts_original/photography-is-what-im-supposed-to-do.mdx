I've been having this thought a lot lately. I just watched a
documentary on Ansel Adams (that's right, I'm a photographer AND a
geek). At one point they are talking about his printing and they
cut to a scene of someone dropping a freshly exposed print into the
developer and you watch the print come up.  
Damn near brought a tear to my eye. I haven't been in a chemical
darkroom in sooooo long. Just the "digital" one that is made up of
the computer in my office. It makes me sad to think that before
long kids taking photography classes won't get to experience the
rush of watching a print come up in the tray. Photography consists
of lots of parts, but witnessing those few moments of transition
when an image builds on a previously blank sheet is the most
magical.  
.... and now I have go buy a new enlarger.
