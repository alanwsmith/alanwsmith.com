Continuing to count down to the Crimson Tide season kickoff with elephants my mom has given me over the years. 

For this one, I changed it up a little and did a blown out white background. There was on strobe behind the scene pointing at a piece of paper that acted as the background. A second strobe to the side shooting through another piece of paper provide the side light.
