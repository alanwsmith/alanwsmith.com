I'm still looking for a soft focus effect in photoshop that I like.
The latest one that I'm working with that I quite pleased with so
far is to run a Gaussian Blur with a radius of 9.0 pixels on a full
size image from a 5D then fade it out to 45%. The effect reminds me
a lot of my old glass Nikon soft focus 1 filter that was a favorite
of mine.
