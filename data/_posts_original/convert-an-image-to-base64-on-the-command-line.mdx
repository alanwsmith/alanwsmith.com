Use the `base64` command with the `> filename` operator to convert an image to base64 and save the string in a file:

```bash
base64 IMAGE_FILE.jpg > OUTPUT.txt
```

You can also export it into an environmental variable for use in other scripts

```bash
export IMAGE_STRING=$(base64 IMAGE_FILE.jpg)
echo $IMAGE_STRING
```
