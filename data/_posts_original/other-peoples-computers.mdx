The Help Desk was working on my laptop for about 5 hours today
trying to solve a firewall/printer problem. For some of that time I
went over and worked on a co-workers machine. It was almost like
trying to write left handed. I've done a ton of little tweaks to my
computer and have a bunch of tech specific software that no one
else at the TOUR has. This got me thinking about tools. While I
think of a computer as a tool, it's really more of a workbench
where you put tools (software) and use them. And it's even possible
to go a step beyond that. Using a programming language you can
build new tools to do whatever you want. Those tools can in turn be
used to create new ones and so on, increasing geometrically. We
tell kids they can be anything they want when they grow up.
Programming is right in line with this. Inside a computer
environment you can create basically anything you want, and the
tools to help you create are getting better every day.
