- I've set a custom time for the layer toggle. Down from 200ms to 160ms. This works well for using the Enter key (which I have in the slot below the standard `v` key) as a layer toggle. 
- Tried to put an `LT` layer toggle under the "a" key, but it didn't work out. The way I hit the key, it kept trigger the layer toggle instead of the key press.
