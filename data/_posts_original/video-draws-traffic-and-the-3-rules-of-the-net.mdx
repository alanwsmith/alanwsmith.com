More and more the content I see come across my new reader contains
video, and the quality of that video (both technically and content
wise) continues to increase. Most of the video I consume is not
from the original site. More often than not it's a youTube video
that is embedded on another site. If you are just going for views
of your video this is fine, but the real key is to make sure that
views know who the hell you are. I expect to see an increasing
number of people posting little banners at the start and end of
their videos that contain their specific web site. This is critical
if the creator wants to draw traffic to their own site and
generally speaking, this is the goal since that's where the ads
served make them money. Here's an entertaining example I found on
[Laughing Squid](http://laughingsquid.com/):
Song \# 10! “3 Rules of the Internet” from
[rockcookiebottom.com](http://www.rockcookiebottom.com/). NOTE: For
those of you who are afraid of monkeys, don't worry about the slate
in the video window. Other than that photo, I don't think monkeys
even make an appearance.
