title: I'm Not Competing Against Other Streamers
type: post

Watched the debate last night. Or, at least, the first half of it. 

I have this idea in my head of what being presidential looks like. That wasn't it. 

I'm not going to get into politics on the internet. That's not what I do, but, bleck. 

Anyway, I was just looking up some stuff on other streamers. It's really neat to see the stats behind some of them. I just found [@noopkat](https://www.twitch.tv/noopkat). Her last stream had 4K viewers and she's got 26K subscribers. That's awesome. 

What's interesting is that I'm not intimidated by that. I'm also not intimidated by the complex code that I see and some of the other live streamers doing. I'm just doing my thing and they're doing theirs. Competition and comparison don't enter the equation. 

It's like these journals. They're just something I'm doing. It goes into the public space but I'm not doing things just to try to grown an audience. This is something that's been on my mind a lot as I do this and the vlog. I don't want to get into something where I'm just trying to get bigger numbers. That's one reason I kinda hope I don't have to make a decision about getting money from Twitch. 

But, that equation changed a little when I looked at the rates. Twitch charges $5 per month per subscription and the streamer gets 50% of that. That's $30/year. So, with 100 subscribers, that's $3,000 year. That's not money I would turn down. I totally thought this was going to be like YouTube which is $3-5 per 1,000 views. So, that would take a million views to get the same $3,000. 

Do I think I'll ever get 100 subscribers? No, I can't imagine how that would happen. So, I don't expect to need to worry about it. And, I like that. I'd rather money not become a factor in this. The exception being if I can switch to it full time on a salary. So that, no matter how many viewers I have I get the same. I just want money out of the equation. 

(And, yes, I recognize that's a super privileged thing to say.)
