Installed the trial copy of Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom today on my
laptop and dropped some test images in from my 5D. I haven't done
much with it, but just moving thru the images is a pleasure. It's
nice and responsive for quickly moving thru a set of images. Just
that is probably enough to make me get a copy. I had been using
Adobe's Bridge to look thru my RAW images, and it's just not very
quick. It also has a custom name import feature that I like so that
I can name the filenames to my spec. For me that is making the file
name in a date format: "YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS". For example,
"20070223-184203.CR2". While all this data is inside the meta
information as well, I like the fact that this effectively produces
a unique file name for every image. I need to see if there is a way
to add a "-1", "-2", "-3", etc... for times when multiple images
get marked with the same second. I haven't seen this yet though. As
near as I can tell with the 5D, the timestamp is based on when the
file gets finished writing instead of when the image itself was
catpures. The camera will shoot 3+ images a second, but it'll take
several seconds to write of them. Anyway, first impression is
pretty good though I haven't really dug into it yet. I've never
really used meta data that much for my stuff. I just save all my
shoots in a give directory, but I have a feeling I will start using
it more as I play around with lightroom. Adobe has a 30 day trail
on their site right now. And for the time being they have lowered
the asking price from $299 to $199 for an "introductory offer".
Definitely worth a try.
