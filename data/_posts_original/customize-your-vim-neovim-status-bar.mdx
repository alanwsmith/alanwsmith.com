This is a copy of the example of how to customize your status line [from here](https://www.vi-improved.org/recommendations/)



```txtx
set statusline=%F%m%r%h%w[%L][%{&ff}]%y[%p%%][%04l,%04v]
"              | | | | |  |   |      |  |     |    |
"              | | | | |  |   |      |  |     |    +-- current column
"              | | | | |  |   |      |  |     +-- current line
