Credit where it's due, these are the notes I took straight from [this page by Kevin Leary](https://www.kevinleary.net/js-fix-for-syntaxerror-cannot-use-import-statement-outside-a-module/)

Node defaults CommonJS. 

That means it uses `require` instead of `import`.

You'll need to switch to treating code as `ECMAScript modules` if you want to use `import`.

You can do that by:

1. Switching your file extension from `.js` to `.mjs`
2. Add `"type": "module"` to `package.json`, or
3. Run your script with `node --input-type module`

You can't use both `import` and `require`. You'll have to choose one or the other.
