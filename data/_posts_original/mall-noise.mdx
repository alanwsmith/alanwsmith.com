I made a rare trip to the mall this weekend. I entered through the
food court which has always struck me as a loud place, but this
time I had a way to provide at least a little measurement. When I
went in, I was listening to my MP3 player. If I'm in the office and
just want a little background to help keep out the rest of the
world I have the volume set at 2 or 3. If I'm out and about and
actively listening to it I have the volume between 4 and 6
depending on how much other noise there is. When I walked into the
food court of the mall, I had to crank the volume up to 21 in order
hear the music clearly. To give you an idea of how loud this is. If
I place the headphones at about 3 feet away and turn the volume up
to 21 in my office I can clearly make out the words and music. It's
a little distorted because my headphones are cheap, but still.
That's pretty loud.
