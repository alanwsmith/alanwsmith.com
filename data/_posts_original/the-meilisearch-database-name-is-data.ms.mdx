Note to self for when I find `data.ms` directories floating around. Those are [Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com) databases. 

They are created in the directory where you start the search engine by default. You can [switch that](https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/features/configuration.html#options) by setting the `MEILI_DB_PATH` env var or `--db-path` from the CLI options.
