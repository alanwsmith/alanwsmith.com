### Window Pane Commands

```
| Action                       | Command               |
|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Make vertical window panes   | Ctrl+b %              |

| Resize pane (GNU)            | Ctrl+b Ctrl+<arrow>   |
```


```
Note: The `Ctrl+b :resize-p -D 4` command means to press `Ctrl+b` then press `:` to enter the command line for the rest of the command (e.g. `resize-p -D 4`). The `-D` flag indicates down. The other options are `-U` for up, `-L` for left, and `-R` for right. The "4" in the example is the amount that can be changed to your desired setting.
