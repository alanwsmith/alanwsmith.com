title: Free CD Burning Software for Windows
---

If you have a CD or DVD burner, but don't have software with it you
can use [CDBurnerXP Pro](http://www.cdburnerxp.se/). It's free and
doesn't contain any spyware. Another alternative is
[Deep Burner](http://www.deepburner.com/). Also, free and devoid of
spyware. Personally, I use CDBurnerXP Pro becuase it has a "verify"
festure that checks a disk after it's burned to make sure
everything copied over correctly.
