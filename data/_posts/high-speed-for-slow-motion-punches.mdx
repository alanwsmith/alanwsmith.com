title: High Speed for Slow Motion Punches

When you shoot a normal video, the camera captures individual
frames at a rate around 30 frames every second. When viewed
normally, and at the same speed, each second that went by during
the recording takes one second to watch in playback. If you use a
camera that captures a higher number of frames per second and play
that back at 30 frames/second you get what we know as a slow-motion
video. By slowing time down in the playback, we can often see
fascinating things that would normally be missed because they
simply happen to fast for our eyes and brain to keep up with. One
of the first examples of this are the set of photos from 1878
called "The Horse in Motion." by
[Eadweard\_Muybridge](http://tr.im/4nuy) who was the first person
to prove scientifically that a horse has all four hooves off the
ground in a gallop. Fast forward 130 years and the technology has,
unsurprisingly, improved significantly. Today, anyone can buy a
consumer level [camera](http://tr.im/4nc7) that shoots at 1,000
frames/second. The sample videos I've seen from this camera aren't
studio quality, but are certainly an example of how far technology
has come. Professional grade cameres are even more impressive. Take
the self-promotion piece created by the production company
[Action Figure](http://tr.im/4nv5). The video is a series of people
getting punched in the face by a boxing glove with the Action
Figure logo. Since it was released, this video has spread all over
YouTube and similar sites, but all those versions seem to be
compressed to the point where they loose the sharp details. The
original QuickTime movies on the Action Figure site really
highlight the quality.

When I was trying to dig up the link for this post, I came across a
few supplemental videos on the Action Figure site as well as the
main one.
-   [Main edited piece with funky track](http://tr.im/4nve)
    (quicktime .mov)
-   [Directory of all clips, including individuals](http://tr.im/4nvl)
-   [String of the punches with out additional editing or sound](http://tr.im/4nvw)
    (quicktime .mov)

While I like the main video with the tune (Shazam's remix of
"[Sweaty](http://www.amazon.com/Sweaty/dp/B0014KDF66/ref=sr_f3_1?ie=UTF8&s=dmusic&qid=1231729104&sr=103-1)"
by Muscles), I am more mesmerized by the sting of individuals where
you see each punch uninteruppted. Watching the way everything moves
provides a glimpse into time that feels almost supernatural. Also,
it's good motivation to try to keep from getting punched in the
face. If you'd like to see some more examples of this, check out
Discovery channel's new show
"[Time Warp](http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/time-warp/time-warp.html)"
that is centered around high-speed camera work.
