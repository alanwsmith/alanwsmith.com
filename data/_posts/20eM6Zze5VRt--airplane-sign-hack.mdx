title: Airplane sign hack
---

My flight back from ATL last night was on a Boeing 767-300. These
aircraft have three rows of seats in the main cabin. Two seats for
the outside rows and three in the middle. As you enter the plane,
the first two rows are "A" and "B". The middle seats are "C", "D"
and "E" with the "F" and "G" making up the last row. I've been on
these flights enough that this is in the back of my brain but a
standard for most passengers I've seen is when they enter the
plane, the ask the flight attendant which aisle they need to go
down to get to their seat. Last night, I saw a great little hack.
One of the flight attendants drew a little diagram with a note
saying that you could get to the A, B, C and D seats from the first
aisle while E, F, and G where the second one. I mentioned that I
thought it was a great idea, and she said that it really seemed to
help. It was in the perfect place. Just as soon as the passenger
realizes they need to make an aisle decision this little sign was
there. I wish I had snagged a picture, but I had already stowed my
camera.
