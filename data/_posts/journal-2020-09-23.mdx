title: Feeling a New Kind of Good
type: post

Yep. 

It feels good to feel good. 

Just realized there are probably folks who say "it feels good to feel god". If not, I should copyright that. I mean, if everyone else is going to make money off god, why shouldn't I? 

Kidding, of course. 

But, yeah, I feel good. 

I almost wrote I think I feel good, but I'm going to go with it. I feel good.

It's still new. But, I'm pretty sure this is what good feels like. I mean, maybe it's that I feel fine? It's all just so new, I don't know what words to use. 

But, I can tell you, it's a good feeling even if it's not feeling good. 

Whatever it is, I'll take it.
