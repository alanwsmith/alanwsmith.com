Does this table work:


| h1              | h2             | h3                 |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------------|
| data1           | data2          | data3              |
| this is a thing | something else | another thing here |


This is with alignment


| h1              | h2             | h3                 |
|:----------------|:--------------:|-------------------:|
| data1           | data2          | data3              |
| this is a thing | something else | another thing here |


Code block

```
this is some code
```

Code block with language

```javascript
const thing = new Date()
```

And now, footnotes. This is the first[^1] one. And the second [^2] one.

[^1]: Footnote number one
[^2]: Footnote number two

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

NOTE: This did not working for assigning a custom ID to a header:

```
### H3 Heading With Custom Style {#customId}
```

Check to see if links to internal anchors work 

<a href="#customId">link to custom header</a>

First Term
: This is the definition of the first term.

Second Term

This is ~~strikethru~~ to make something slashed through.

This is a task list:

- [x] This is done
- [ ] This is to do
- [ ] And another thing that needs to be done
