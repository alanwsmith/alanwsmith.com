Last few times I've been to a computer store I've noticed that more
and more of the displays on laptops are of the ultra shiny sort.
Looking at them in the store, I couldn't imagine that they would be
good to use since the mirror like surface does a great job of
reflecting light and producing glare. The laptop I was looking at
for my mom that we eventually got had one of these screens. I
mentioned this to her before we bought it and figured we could
return it if it was a problem. Once I got it out of the store, I'm
happy to report the screen was just fine to work with. Didn't have
any problems with glare at all. I think this would be the case most
of the time. Unless you happen to work in a place that has endless
rows of overheard fluorescent light strips like an big box store.
