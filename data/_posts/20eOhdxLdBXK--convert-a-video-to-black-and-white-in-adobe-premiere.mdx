title: Convert A Video To Black And White In Adobe Premiere
---

The way I'm doing black and white is going to:

Effects -> Video Effects -> Color Correction -> Lumetri Color

and dropping the effect on the clip

Then I mess around with the parameters with the following adjustment starting points:

- Saturation: 0
- Exposure: 0.7
- Highlights: 22.8
- Blacks: -19.3

There's also a "Video Effects -> Image Control -> Black and White" effect, but I don't see how to adjust it to make it look better.
