I'm shooting the wedding of a couple of friends on Sat. This works
out well because there are a few photo related things that I've
been wanting to pick up for a while. Since I haven't really been
shooting (or even really had a chance to shoot) in the past while I
couldn't really justify getting the stuff. With a wedding though,
easy call. I've also been working tonight to actually get my
recently built computer setup to edit/work-on photos. Pretty darn
excited about that.
