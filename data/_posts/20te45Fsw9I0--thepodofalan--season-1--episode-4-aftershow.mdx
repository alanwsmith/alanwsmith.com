Auto-Generated Transcript (I'm in the process of getting this formatted)

00:00
[Music]
00:05
okay after show
00:07
yeah i i
00:09
the hello world thing it's still i'm
00:10
gonna go back and forth and back forth
00:11
on that because i it's that that little
00:13
introduction that can be nice and
00:14
helpful um yeah so i i really this was
00:18
one of those where i was definitely
00:19
going through the idea of let's just
00:21
let's just make one and see what happens
00:24
and i was pushing on it a little bit
00:25
more than usual
00:28
because i didn't like when i was doing
00:30
the car ones
00:31
it would often be
00:34
i don't know maybe i'd do a couple in a
00:36
week and then it would be a few weeks
00:37
before i do another one
00:39
and usually there would be something
00:41
specific that would get me
00:44
to do one like i'd have like i'd see
00:46
something or think about something or
00:47
whatever and that would be
00:49
the the process it would kind of like
00:50
percolate in my mind and then i'd be
00:53
like oh okay i'd like next time in the
00:54
car i'm gonna go talk about this and
00:56
i'll start talking about this
00:58
and then we'll turn the and the mic will
01:00
be on and we'll just let it go and we'll
01:01
see we'll see what happens um
01:03
with
01:04
with this one i didn't have as much i i
01:06
wanted to talk about the alabama
01:08
football thing because that was new
01:09
but then like as i started to do the
01:12
recording i kind of like that kind of
01:13
phased out of my brain so it wasn't like
01:15
it was super
01:16
um percolating in there it wasn't super
01:19
front of mind um and it hadn't like
01:24
you know stewed a little bit and kind of
01:26
like
01:27
i can't think of any other cooking
01:28
analogies right now but like it hadn't
01:30
like
01:31
solidified or
01:34
ripened probably ripened as a good word
01:35
like it hadn't the thought hadn't
01:36
ripened into
01:38
something more uh tangible
01:41
but i was i wanted to see what happens
01:42
if we if we try these and i'm also
01:45
interested it's it's a kind of an
01:47
interesting balance because
01:49
i'm interested in getting several of
01:51
these out and going so um i think i've
01:55
done three episodes each with an after
01:56
show so that's six
01:58
this will be
01:59
four which will be eight and
02:02
i'm i'm pushing them out as as the as we
02:04
go now like uh i'm i'm gonna find the
02:06
software probably this evening or the
02:08
this weekend to
02:09
to line the thing up and go um
02:12
and like
02:13
like actually send it out and say like
02:15
hey here's the thing like i've already
02:16
put it up on the site uh i just need to
02:18
get it in a podcast
02:20
uh
02:21
application basically so that it can
02:22
show up in a player
02:23
and for that i need to figure out
02:25
exactly how i'm going to do it because
02:27
one of the aspects that i want with this
02:29
is
02:30
i don't necessarily want this tied to a
02:32
given service
02:34
what i mean by that is if i if i have it
02:37
hosted somewhere
02:39
um
02:40
the link
02:42
from the from like on your application
02:44
when your application goes and gets the
02:45
podcast it will be pointed at that
02:47
service
02:49
and i don't want that to happen i wanted
02:50
to be pointed at my website at my place
02:53
specifically i can do all the hosting of
02:54
the like the files and all the other
02:55
stuff somewhere else but like the actual
02:57
connection between the podcast app and
03:00
the
03:02
the feed that like
03:03
makes the podcast happen i want that
03:05
feed to be on my site
03:07
so that that way
03:09
i have control over i'm not i'm not like
03:11
what we call vendor lock-in or vendor
03:13
locked in locked into a vendor where
03:16
uh if i've got it on you know podcast
03:19
service a
03:21
and they go out of business which could
03:23
happen or they get bought and they start
03:26
changing their business model which can
03:28
very likely have like that can really
03:30
happen
03:31
then
03:32
i i want to have the capability of
03:34
moving it to some other place
03:36
but the way that i can do that is by not
03:38
starting it in a foreign place to begin
03:41
with and just writing it straight off of
03:43
my site but i don't have to
03:45
build all the stuff
03:47
to to make a full podcast thing like i
03:49
don't have to do the hosting i don't
03:50
have to do whatever but if i can just
03:53
and i think what i'm going to do
03:55
is i'm going to find a service that i
03:56
like
03:57
and i'm going to host everything there
03:59
and they're gonna provide that feed that
04:02
populates the podcast
04:03
but instead of pointing all you know
04:07
spotify and apple music and overcast and
04:09
all the other things to that feed
04:11
i'm gonna make a copy of the feed on my
04:13
site and then just point everything
04:14
there because that way i've got that
04:16
control over it because i
04:17
a thing that i have i've run into
04:20
a few times and in general with
04:23
stuff on the web is
04:26
the longevity of the thing where
04:30
i was i was just looking today for
04:32
um an article from uh uh author named
04:36
corey doctorow doctoro again i don't
04:38
know how to say that
04:39
uh about the outboard brain and like i
04:41
found the page
04:43
like i found the link to the page
04:46
and it had the title
04:47
and it had the byline
04:50
but it did not have the contents of the
04:51
actual article that was the story that i
04:54
was looking for
04:55
and so i went like five or six other
04:56
places including one place that's uh
04:58
this this site that's called the
05:00
internet uh archive or the wayback
05:01
machine
05:02
and it wasn't on the wayback machine and
05:04
it wasn't over here and wasn't over
05:05
there so i kept i kept digging around
05:07
and i finally found it but that is a
05:10
problem with links where
05:13
it's it's really easy for links to go um
05:16
to go away on the site and it's also
05:18
really easy for services to change so
05:20
for example if i'm gonna go onto a
05:21
podcast service and right now they they
05:24
don't put ads on your
05:26
uh
05:27
podcast
05:28
that doesn't mean that they won't soon
05:30
or that they won't get bought in that
05:31
other place would like the the the
05:34
ownership of
05:36
the experience belonging to somebody
05:38
else means you are at their whim
05:41
and
05:43
that can be fine
05:45
especially short term but i'm thinking
05:47
about this long term especially because
05:48
i've just spent all this time working on
05:49
my website that's
05:50
like i've got 15 years of content on
05:52
there and the website's like five or six
05:54
or seven years older than that
05:56
so i very much want to think like i like
05:58
is this company that i'm working with
06:00
gonna be around that long
06:01
maybe but are they gonna change their
06:02
business model maybe so
06:05
that's kind of where my head's at with
06:06
that um
06:08
and we'll
06:09
as we'll see like it
06:11
i'm going to do whatever work it takes
06:13
to make sure that i have control of the
06:15
thing because i don't want to seed
06:17
control of the podcast
06:19
to anybody um and that that'll make sure
06:22
that
06:22
it lives for as long as i have it going
06:24
like i i will be in control of its
06:26
destiny um
06:28
if i let the server die that it's on
06:30
then that's on me but hopefully that
06:32
won't happen um but yeah so
06:35
i don't know i i figured that'll do it
06:37
for now the i'm gonna go do some work on
06:39
that and we'll get the podcast actually
06:42
kind of running up and moving
06:43
and
06:45
visible to people and and we'll see it
06:47
from there so everybody have a good one
06:50
take it easy be kind we will see you
06:52
next time cheers
