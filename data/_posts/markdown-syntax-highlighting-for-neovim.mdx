I'm using [vim-markdown](https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown) for syntax highlighting of markdown file code fences in neovim. 

The instillation instructions don't mention `Plug` but this worked for me inside `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`

    call plug#begin("~/.vim/plugged")
        " ... other plugins
        Plug 'godlygeek/tabular'
        Plug 'plasticboy/vim-markdown'
    call plug#end()

Followed by running this from the command line

    nvim +PlugInstall
    
Or, starting nvim and running the command:

    :PlugInstall
