title: Sweet Home Alabama with the Red Army Choir
---

Apparently this is from a 1994 MTV awards show. The Leningrad
Cowboys and the Red Army Choir performing Sweet Home Alabama.
I'm not sure what to think, but it's pretty awesome in that kinda
hurts my mind to see the Red Army Choir doing Skynard type of way.
