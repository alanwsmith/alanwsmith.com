title: Divesting of Nikon
---

I'm on my way to Huntsville for a few days. I've decided that I'm
going to drop off most of my Nikon gear at Southerland's to sell.
On the block will be:
-   20mm f/2.8
-   24mm f/2.8
-   50mm f/1.8
-   105mm f/2.5
-   MD-4 Motordrive

I'm keeping my F3 HP body and a 35mm f/2.8 for the shelf. The F3
was my first camera and the 35 is my favoriate perspective for a
general carry 35mm film camera. I've focused a lot of light through
the lenses I'm getting rid of, but since I'm hanging onto a working
system, I don't feel (right now) like I'm giving anything up
really. That said, I'm hanging on to all my Hasselblad components
at this point. I'm not ready to give any of them up yet.
