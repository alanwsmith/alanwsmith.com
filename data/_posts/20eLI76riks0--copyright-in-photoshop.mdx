title: Copyright in Photoshop
---

For those of you that use Adobe PhotoShop. If you want to add a
text copyright stamp to your image while using the text tool you
can do it by holding down the "Alt" key and then pressing the
following number in order on your number pad: 0, 1, 6, 9.  
While you are typing in the numbers you won't see anything change.
Once you punched in all four and release the "Alt" key, the
copyright symbol will appear.
