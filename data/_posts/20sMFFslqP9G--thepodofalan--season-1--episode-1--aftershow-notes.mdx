Hello, Aftershow! 

Welcome to the show after the show! 

After I finished an episode I usually leave the mic on and keep going for a while. A kind of reset and review and wind down and maybe some context. This is the first one of those. Offered for your entertainment.

Topics include: 

- Loose guidelines 
- Playing vs Trying and changing the language in our heads
- Doing something like trash does not mean we are trash
- etc... vs "blah, blah, blah"
- We'll touch on mental health and bipolar disorder 
- On the therapeutic value of talking to the camera

Ideas:

- Write an app that gauges my speech to see if it can detect signs of depression

00:04
and now we're doing the after show okay
00:08
oh my god this is so weird
00:12
all right so
00:13
sometimes you have to show things and
00:15
again i guess this is just we're doing
00:16
the introduction stuff so
00:20
and it's why so here's here's the thing
00:21
that i'm thinking is
00:23
i am just going to start these fresh
00:26
like i've already like we've just done
00:27
that like we've started these fresh and
00:28
then over time i would like to go back
00:31
and get all the episodes and all the
00:32
stuff that i've done prior
00:34
but like that's gonna take work um
00:37
because basically i've gotta go listen
00:39
to all that stuff and and like i don't
00:40
have to do too much editing but when i
00:42
was first doing those
00:44
um
00:47
one i was hypomanic or manic depending
00:48
on the day and with untreated bipolar
00:51
disorder so hooray but the
00:54
but the other aspect with that is i
00:55
wasn't really
00:58
i hadn't kind of refined what i was
00:59
gonna say versus what i wasn't gonna say
01:01
and i have very few rules very few rules
01:04
about what i'm not going to say
01:06
um largely it is gonna be that i'm not
01:09
gonna talk i'm not gonna say people's
01:10
names unless i have their permission to
01:12
say their names and
01:14
uh i'm not gonna talk too much about
01:16
work stuff because work stuff is work
01:17
stuff and
01:19
even though i do get into that um
01:22
and i'm not really gonna go like super
01:23
political like that's just not there's
01:26
enough of that out there i don't think
01:28
my voice in the middle of that stuff is
01:30
gonna help particularly um on a on a
01:32
broader level so uh individually sure
01:34
but like
01:36
in the noise not so much so that's
01:38
basically it um everything else is is
01:41
and i don't want to say fair game
01:42
because that makes it sound like we're
01:44
after it and like oh yeah we could go
01:46
take this stuff down like fair game is
01:47
like we're hunting things or whatever
01:48
but like everything else is just on the
01:49
plate everything else is in play
01:51
um and i really
01:53
i really like the words in play we'll
01:54
get to play a lot i'm sure um
01:57
because i i really like this idea of
01:59
playing with stuff um the
02:02
the one that's come up recently with me
02:03
is
02:04
uh
02:06
if
02:07
if you're gonna work on something or if
02:09
you're gonna try for something or if
02:11
you're gonna make an attempt at
02:12
something
02:14
don't use that language necessarily
02:16
don't say
02:18
oh i'm going to try to do this thing
02:20
because if i try to do it
02:22
i might fail and then that can lead very
02:25
much of
02:27
if i have failed at this thing then i am
02:29
a failure because the the tendency for
02:32
us to
02:34
put
02:36
our
02:38
success or failure on a thing that we've
02:40
done which is actually outside of us
02:42
is high like that's that's that's we
02:44
don't have a lot of training i don't
02:45
think to make a disconnect there it's
02:46
like i did a thing that thing failed but
02:50
i am okay because like it's not that i
02:52
am a failure that thing failed um i was
02:54
talking with somebody last night uh
02:56
playing some games and
02:58
uh they're having a bad game and they
03:01
said i'm trash
03:04
and like it's i know him well enough to
03:05
basically say okay so we have to talk
03:08
about this and it's like whatever i
03:09
wasn't getting all preachy whatever like
03:11
it's not that you're it's not
03:13
it's not that you're trash it's that
03:14
you're playing like trash but those are
03:16
those are two different things and like
03:17
that's really like that mental switch is
03:22
huge
03:24
and i see so many people
03:26
that have not
03:28
been shown that that is an option of the
03:30
way that to think and so one of the
03:32
things that i'm interested in with this
03:33
i guess is is talking about some of that
03:36
stuff and like i've i've picked up on a
03:38
few things
03:39
that i find interesting and helpful in
03:41
my life and so some of what we'll talk
03:43
about is the things that i found
03:45
interesting and useful in my life and
03:46
that's a big one it's the internal
03:47
language that we use
03:49
in our heads as we're talking to ourself
03:51
and our self narratives and
03:53
our inner monologue and inner dialogue
03:55
depending um
03:58
but yeah so that was that that was a
03:59
good one but yeah so this this is just
04:01
going to be
04:02
i don't know and so like it's fun with
04:03
the after show stuff because the after
04:05
show is really the show
04:07
it's just another episode but with the
04:08
break and then sometimes it's less
04:11
i don't know i i
04:12
it just it it's i switch it up just a
04:14
little bit and then i kind of like
04:17
de-gear and then see what happens next
04:20
sometimes i go on for a little while
04:21
sometimes i don't
04:25
sometimes i pause for a second and have
04:26
coffee sometimes i don't uh yeah so i
04:28
guess we might as well get some of the
04:29
other stuff out of the way just the prep
04:31
stuff and like i was
04:33
i was trying not to do too much of a
04:37
this is what this thing is going to be
04:38
about and this is not what it's going to
04:39
be about blah blah blah blah blah blah
04:40
not sorry i didn't mean blah blah blah
04:41
blah blah blah but like et cetera et
04:42
cetera et cetera oh that's better
04:43
there's good language for you
04:45
instead of blah blah blah blah blah say
04:46
et cetera et cetera et cetera because
04:48
blah blah blah blah blah can kind of
04:50
have a
04:51
negative punch to it
04:54
versus etc etc which also could a little
04:56
bit but it's less
04:58
weighted with
05:01
stuff um well less weighted with weight
05:03
i don't know um
05:05
but yeah i was gonna go without
05:08
talking too much about that initially
05:10
but like
05:11
this is like the way that i do this is i
05:13
just talk about whatever the like
05:15
welcome to
05:16
this episode of uh what's it called free
05:20
form thought no what's it called uh
05:21
stream of consciousness with alan um
05:25
yeah so hello world welcome to stream of
05:26
consciousness
05:28
that's uh i wonder how many podcasts are
05:31
are like that like
05:33
go with um
05:35
a much more stream of consciousness
05:37
thing versus really kind of having a
05:38
topic or whatever and i mean i i think
05:42
you have to have
05:44
some portion
05:46
of like you have to be able to do
05:48
a decent amount of stream of
05:49
consciousness or like back and forth or
05:51
whatever
05:52
in order to keep the dialogue going
05:55
but
05:56
as for just like getting on and going
05:57
like this this is like i'm here i'll
05:58
have to look around and see i i haven't
06:00
heard too many other podcasts like that
06:01
now it could mean that there's a billion
06:03
out there and just nobody likes them
06:05
which oh well so what uh
06:08
but also it may not be that there's as
06:10
many out there who knows um a thing that
06:13
i've i've learned of late is that my
06:15
brain works a little bit differently
06:16
than most people's so
06:18
i am the neurodivergent or in the
06:20
neurodivergent crew um the oh yeah so i
06:23
guess as you say i think i mentioned
06:24
earlier but like so uh bipolar disorder
06:26
hey bipolar one checking in and
06:29
but that's i kind of don't but don't i
06:30
don't care about that like that's
06:31
probably not gonna come up super often
06:35
it will come up from time to time but
06:37
that's not
06:39
like i'm not interested in this being
06:41
like
06:42
oh alan the bipolar person
06:44
like that's not
06:46
like that is it's so it's it's funny to
06:48
me because it's so not
06:50
i am privileged enough that
06:53
the stuff that i deal with
06:56
has been crappy at times to say the
06:59
least
07:00
but it's not it doesn't ride high in my
07:03
brain all the time like i kind of don't
07:06
think about it most of the time
07:09
because i'm very fortunate in the way
07:10
that i have a very good psychiatrist who
07:12
got me on the right meds and my body is
07:13
responding to those meds etc etcetera
07:16
etcetera instead of plus and
07:21
so like that's gonna that's gonna be in
07:22
the mix but it's not gonna be like hey
07:24
this is the bipolar podcast with alan
07:25
coming at you live from five or whatever
07:28
um also i want i really so the other one
07:31
that i want to do
07:33
is
07:34
i want to do a and i just i just slowed
07:37
down my my voice a little bit not my
07:39
voice my uh the tempo of my language the
07:41
temple my words whatever they got speech
07:43
slowed down my speech i guess
07:45
just a touch because i'm kind of excited
07:47
about this but the one of the things
07:49
that i want to do is
07:51
uh use like some of the amazon aws
07:54
services to actually like count words
07:56
per minute and
07:59
do some like graphing of the episodes of
08:01
like
08:02
uh because like some of the episodes i
08:04
recorded like way back
08:05
was in the middle of some pretty severe
08:07
depression
08:08
and like i think it'd be interesting to
08:10
see like if i record these every now and
08:14
then like this could actually be used as
08:16
a gauge to say
08:18
like or
08:18
the question becomes can this be used as
08:21
a gauge
08:23
uh or an indicator to say hey your
08:26
speech is slowing down
08:28
you might like check in with your
08:30
therapist
08:32
even though i check in with them every
08:33
week but check in with your therapist
08:35
because this might be some signs of
08:36
depression kind of stuff um or at least
08:39
an alert to that
08:40
that's one that i've wanted to do for a
08:41
while and i got a bunch of stuff that we
08:42
can mess with so like we'll play with
08:44
that too
08:45
anyways uh that's probably enough
08:47
running around and tangents and stuff
08:49
for now uh i'm gonna go figure out how
08:50
to post this stuff
08:52
uh and we will post it and see what
08:55
happens
08:56
i i just this is this is one of those
08:58
i'm in very much in the in the
09:00
mood or in the mode
09:02
of like get up and go and get the things
09:05
done like i have
09:06
i have a
09:10
uh
09:11
and this is the these are things that
09:13
you will hear me working on a lot as i
09:15
do this because some of this by the way
09:16
is kind of therapeutic for me um and
09:20
having talked with my therapist i was
09:21
like this feels a little bit like a kind
09:22
of therapy she's like yeah it kind of is
09:24
i was like okay cool um so thank you
09:26
audience uh we'll talk talk about rubber
09:28
ducking which is how programmers talk to
09:30
inanimate things to help them sort
09:31
things out which is kind of what this is
09:33
as well
09:34
um
09:35
but
09:36
i completely forgot what i was talking
09:37
about there so i sometimes i'll lose the
09:39
train and uh and as we jump off the
09:41
train
09:42
uh oh i remember what it is yeah
09:44
somebody go back we're gonna post some
09:45
stuff i'm very like i have this thing
09:46
and we'll talk about this more later
09:48
where i have a new
09:51
[Music]
09:54
something
09:57
access to energy but control of the
10:00
energy
10:02
and
10:03
non
10:06
like basically i'm medicated now and i'm
10:08
stable
10:09
but i still have the ability to be
10:11
creative and have the ability to do
10:12
stuff
10:14
and so i'm really curious to see what i
10:16
can do
10:18
as on when i'm stable and
10:20
also it's like part of it's like i wanna
10:21
like i have this pent up energy to do
10:23
stuff
10:24
but it's not like the
10:26
it's not like
10:29
this giant dam that's about to break and
10:31
like burst through it's just like oh
10:32
i've got like this reserve of stuff that
10:34
i've been that i've been saving up for a
10:36
long time so it's like i've got i've got
10:38
like a
10:39
enough money that i can take a really
10:41
good vacation into creativity
10:44
without worrying too much about it
10:47
does that make sense
10:49
so weird to ask if
10:51
people on the other end if that makes
10:52
sense but probably this could happen
10:53
sometimes anyways you all have a good
10:55
one we will uh we will do this again
10:57
soon till then take care be kind and
10:59
we'll see you next time cheers
