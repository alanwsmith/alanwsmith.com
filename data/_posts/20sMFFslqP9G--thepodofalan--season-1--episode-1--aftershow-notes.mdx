Hello, Aftershow! 

Welcome to the show after the show! 

After I finished an episode I usually leave the mic on and keep going for a while. A kind of reset and review and wind down and maybe some context. This is the first one of those. Offered for your entertainment.

Topics include: 

- Loose guidelines 
- Playing vs Trying and changing the language in our heads
- Doing something like trash does not mean we are trash
- etc... vs "blah, blah, blah"
- We'll touch on mental health and bipolar disorder 
- On the therapeutic value of talking to the camera

Ideas:

- Write an app that gauges my speech to see if it can detect signs of depression
