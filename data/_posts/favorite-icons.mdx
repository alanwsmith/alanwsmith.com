I've been meaning to put a Favorite Icon on my site for some time and finally got around to it this weekend. It's on the home page right now and I'll get it lined up on the blog soon. Because of the way browsers cache files it may take some time to see it. Also, with browsers like IE6, I don't think it shows up unless you actually bookmark the page. 

Thanks again to CJ for the logo creation. 

It works at 16 pixels tall. Awesome. 

If you are interested in how to do it, the easiest way is to follow the steps and use the tool on [this page](http://tools.dynamicdrive.com/favicon/). 

Now, if you don't own the site, you would need to put the favicon.ico file in a different location and setup the relative links to point to it as well. If anyone is interested, I'd be happy to put up further directions.
