title: Dont drive while looking at your laptop
---

Coincidences are fun. Driving into work this morning there was a
story on NPR talking about the recent trend toward adding full
fledged multimedia systems to cars. Separate video for everyone,
DVD players, game systems, you name it. Part of the discussion
talking about a law in Connecticut where cops can ticket you for
anything that's a distraction while driving. The examples given
were of talking on a cell phone, shaving, or yelling at the kids in
the back. About ten seconds after the story was over I sheriff
passed me going the other way. The funny thing was he was working
on the little laptop they have mounted in the passenger seat more
than he was watching the road. (Note: This was actually from
yesterday morning, but I didn't post it till today.)
