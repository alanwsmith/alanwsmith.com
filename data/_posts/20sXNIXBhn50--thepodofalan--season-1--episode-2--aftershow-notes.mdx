[Music]
00:05
and after show
00:08
wow
00:08
so i think i'm gonna apparently i'm just
00:10
gonna laugh when i start each one of the
00:11
after shows um
00:13
okay we're gonna slow down now because
00:15
that got a little fast-paced i
00:20
i like doing these
00:22
i do i very much do um
00:27
i'm gonna like chill out here for a
00:28
minute the
00:32
yeah like i keep going back and forth on
00:37
this idea of
00:41
where we are in our relationship dear
00:44
listener you and i
00:48
because
00:51
there will be
00:54
like i'm talking like i'm talking to you
00:55
individually right this is me having a
00:57
communication with you
01:00
but i don't know
01:02
what portion
01:05
of our relationship already exists to
01:08
you and what doesn't
01:14
so like i have
01:16
so like there's there's different ways
01:18
and here's here's where i'm headed with
01:19
this
01:20
there's different ways that
01:23
somebody can interact with these
01:24
episodes
01:25
or interact with me through these
01:26
episodes
01:27
or that we can have an interaction
01:29
through this medium of the podcast i
01:31
guess
01:34
but so
01:35
one way is
01:38
you could pick up the podcast
01:40
like this week
01:42
um as soon as i so i'm gonna release
01:44
like whatever probably i'm gonna put i
01:46
guess five three four three five seven
01:49
excuse me number of episodes
01:52
that i'm gonna publish and then i will
01:53
actually put puts a podcast out like i'm
01:55
gonna i wanna i want a slew of them
01:56
there so that like there's a bunch of
01:57
stuff there ready to go
01:59
five six seven ten i don't know how many
02:01
but some number of episodes will exist
02:05
i get to cut that number in half by the
02:06
way because i'm doing the after shows so
02:07
like cool so like we're already gonna be
02:10
at four um so yes i'll probably go to
02:12
ten
02:13
but
02:15
you could pick this up basically as soon
02:17
as i release it
02:18
and listen along and then listen along
02:20
and follow in real time
02:23
some of the episodes that i'm gonna do
02:25
are gonna be publishing ones that i did
02:28
back over the past two years maybe even
02:30
actually i think it's three years
02:32
because maybe four years i can't
02:33
remember it's been a while
02:36
but like
02:37
those things started just as recording
02:39
videos and i could actually go all the
02:40
way back because there's another aspect
02:41
here which is
02:43
when i really first started doing
02:44
recording and first i had the idea of a
02:45
podcast really pop into my brain and
02:47
thought actually i thought about this in
02:48
a while but is when i had my first uh
02:51
major manic episode
02:53
and i ran around my house naked
02:55
recording for like four days um until i
02:57
went to the hospital
02:59
that's a story for another time but like
03:02
all that content exists i'm going to
03:04
publish that i'm going to publish all
03:05
the other podcasts i've done my cars
03:07
over the years our car over the years
03:10
actually cars i've been through two cars
03:12
with that thing um
03:15
and so but i so i will publish those in
03:18
a stream
03:19
and that stream will include these plus
03:21
those in different orders potentially
03:23
but those so those will be out of their
03:25
own time
03:26
but then you can actually go back and
03:28
actually chronic like i could sort these
03:30
things chronologically and make a feed
03:31
that's a chronological feed that gets to
03:33
it so like if you've started that feed
03:35
of the bigging and walked all the way
03:37
through
03:38
you've now listened to me for 100
03:39
episodes and you're hearing me talking
03:41
about starting again but acknowledging
03:42
that i'm starting again right um you
03:44
could just hear a single episode like
03:46
you could just hear this because for
03:48
whatever reason you found it
03:50
or you could hear some of the future
03:52
ones and then come back to this like you
03:54
could like you could pick up the you
03:56
could pick up the catalog in five years
03:57
you could listen to the last three
03:59
episodes then decide you want to go all
04:00
the way back to the start but do it and
04:01
start with this like there's all these
04:03
interactions and all these ways
04:05
and
04:06
i don't know
04:08
[Music]
04:09
like it's just an interesting thing for
04:12
me just so this is like this is
04:15
giving you a perspective of a thing that
04:17
i'm thinking about here which is like i
04:18
don't know how to talk to you
04:21
because i don't know
04:23
where in our relationship we are
04:26
and the
04:27
first thing as soon as i said that that
04:28
came to mind is uh if you have ever
04:31
watched doctor who
04:32
um and you're familiar with the
04:34
storyline of river song
04:37
there's similarities there um
04:40
that is really intriguing um
04:43
that story's probably done in several
04:44
places or whatever but like that's the
04:45
one i i like doctor who a lot and
04:48
that's that's a good one i'm not gonna
04:50
spoil i'm not gonna spoilers
04:53
um
04:54
i will just say that there are parallels
04:56
there uh
04:57
also if you've not watched doctor who i
04:59
think i have on my website a list of
05:01
episodes of doctor who that you want to
05:03
watch you can either watch all of them
05:05
or it's like a parse down list of
05:07
um the ones that by general consensus
05:10
people said like these are like the the
05:12
main story ones and get you like not
05:14
having to watch all the ones that
05:15
maybe either aren't great or aren't the
05:17
best um
05:18
that aren't like central to the main
05:20
storyline
05:23
but yeah so it's i don't know it's like
05:24
there's there's going to be some back
05:26
and forth of
05:29
figuring that out but increasingly and
05:31
and you'll actually
05:33
hear this as i go through with some of
05:35
the other things from from the years ago
05:36
from the from the before times from the
05:38
forecasts i guess oh before cast
05:41
ah that's not bad um from the before
05:44
cast
05:48
before but like forecast yeah okay
05:50
that's interesting i don't know i don't
05:51
play with that one um
05:54
but it's also like i kept
05:56
i would keep running into this issue of
06:02
this same type of stuff like trying to
06:03
figure out like where we are so whatever
06:05
like we'll hear all about that um but
06:07
yeah so this this will be this is kind
06:09
of the way that i think these might run
06:11
where
06:13
we do a
06:17
an episode like a proper episode and
06:19
then i kind of chill out and then back
06:21
off a little bit or whatever because
06:22
like i sometimes get rammed up like i i
06:25
think i will tend my expectation is i
06:27
will tend to get ramped up in the
06:28
original episodes
06:29
and then as i do those
06:31
then i'll kind of cut back but sometimes
06:33
absolutely what will happen is i'll
06:35
still be like rolling on the idea
06:37
and we'll get back into it again and
06:39
whatever um also who knows how long is
06:40
it gonna last like summer will last a
06:42
while someone lasts less long i'm not
06:44
worried about any of that um the other
06:46
thing just to put straight out there is
06:47
i am in no way looking for a sponsorship
06:50
or
06:52
any type of monetariable monetary
06:55
monetary thing associated with this like
06:58
i
06:59
my goal
07:01
is to be able to do this
07:04
for myself
07:05
for the thing that i want to do with no
07:08
external thing um lots of people run
07:10
podcasts and they're trying to get
07:11
sponsorships and doing the things
07:12
totally get that i'm in a position where
07:14
i don't have to worry about that and
07:18
i'm also in a position where
07:22
the the effort like the the way that i
07:24
would have to go about trying to like
07:26
monetize and do that stuff would make me
07:28
not want to do this like it's this extra
07:30
effort it's having to do it it's like
07:31
having all the sponsorship in it's
07:33
trying to like cut in ads or do you like
07:34
all that other stuff like i just that
07:36
would make me not do this thing
07:38
and i want to continue to do the thing
07:40
so like it's just it's just not gonna
07:42
happen um same thing happened with my
07:44
website for the longest time i
07:45
did never did ads never did any of that
07:47
stuff for a very brief time i put um
07:51
like sponsor not sponsorship but like uh
07:54
the links where if you click on them
07:56
you get money if somebody clicks on them
07:57
and it goes to amazon or whatever um
08:00
now
08:01
am i saying that i would never do that
08:02
again no this like if i do this for the
08:05
next 50 years and like all of a sudden
08:07
there's a bunch of followers a bunch of
08:08
listeners whatever and like they're
08:09
clicking on stuff and like i could get
08:11
some money off of that yeah sure maybe
08:13
but
08:15
as much as possible i'm gonna push back
08:16
against that unless it's like okay
08:19
are you there there is everybody's got a
08:21
number i have a number i don't know what
08:23
that i haven't really thought what that
08:24
number is but there's a number out there
08:25
absolutely but i am not at all worried
08:28
about that and i'm not worried and i
08:29
don't ever want to have to inch close to
08:31
it like i don't have to get there inch
08:32
by inch like either
08:34
i'm going to be at 0 or i'm going to be
08:36
100. like i don't want to like move
08:38
through and have to deal with it that
08:39
way um
08:40
and i i'm not and please understand i'm
08:43
not trying to like knock on folks that
08:44
do that um
08:46
that's just that's not where my head's
08:47
at so
08:49
uh i think that'll run it for this one
08:51
too
08:51
and
08:53
yeah it feels about right so uh the
08:56
other thing that i still have to figure
08:57
out a little bit about is getting out of
08:58
these like what's the as good strategy
09:00
like so maybe i should just say and now
09:02
i'm going to eject and then like
09:04
or do whatever the sound is but i don't
09:06
know let's go we'll figure that out
09:09
appreciate you all
09:10
take it easy be kind we will see you
09:12
next time
09:13
cheers
