title: More Hands - Daft this time
---

In the spirit of the hand clapping from the
[earlier post](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/2008/02/11/excellence-in-almost-anything-tends-to-amaze/).
Here's another hand related vid that's just fun. And groovy.
It takes a min to get going, hangs out for a bit in the realm of
intresting, then gets just a bit crazy. I'm not sure which came
first, the hands or the bodies, but this one is also fun:
I doubt I have either the fine or gross motor skills to pull of
either one of these. Makes me wonder how many takes it took to
produce these since there's no cuts. I'd like to think it was just
one for each.
