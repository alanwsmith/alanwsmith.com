Auto-Generated Transcript (I'm in the process of getting this formatted)

00:00
[Music]
00:05
i completely forgot what i was going to
00:06
say i had like a thing to start this one
00:09
with
00:10
but i can't remember what it was so
00:12
we're just going to kind of keep oh wait
00:13
i do remember something to the effect of
00:15
a funny thing happened on the way to the
00:16
internet today
00:18
um and the reason i say that is i had a
00:20
tweet go viral um for the first time
00:23
which was kind of cool um
00:26
the
00:27
i've been doing like there's this like
00:29
format tweet thing that's been around
00:30
for a while where it is i am blah blah
00:33
blah or i am dot dot dot dot years old
00:36
and you insert dot dot with whatever
00:38
your particular thing is you're kind of
00:39
making uh funny of
00:42
and so the one i did last night or i
00:44
guess two nights ago now whatever was
00:48
uh
00:49
i am afraid to put something like i'm
00:51
afraid to put spaces and file names
00:53
years old um and that's a computer thing
00:56
where
00:58
it used to be that you couldn't put a
00:59
space in a file name like it because it
01:01
would just break a bunch of stuff well
01:03
it turns out on some of the tech stuff
01:04
that we still use today that can still
01:07
be a problem most of the time if you're
01:08
like making you know word documents or
01:10
whatever it's not a big deal
01:12
but if you're doing some of the behind
01:14
the scenes stuff and some of the more
01:15
technical stuff and sometimes stuff on
01:16
the web or with apps
01:19
that's still a problem um and the reason
01:21
it's a problem is
01:23
when you're issuing commands to a
01:25
computer you will say like hey computer
01:28
i want you to copy this file from here
01:30
to here
01:31
and you put a space in between the first
01:33
here and the second here so the computer
01:35
knows like oh the first one is the is
01:37
where i'm starting and the second one is
01:38
where it's going
01:40
well if you have a space in the file
01:42
name
01:43
it sees that space and it thinks oh
01:46
that first part of the file name is the
01:49
first thing that i'm supposed to look at
01:50
and then there's a space and then
01:52
whatever the second word or the file
01:53
name is is the second thing and it can
01:55
cause all kinds of just
01:57
really
01:58
annoying and sometimes painful bugs but
02:02
that tweet took off
02:04
um so it got it got passed around
02:06
twitter a little bit and then a friend
02:09
who's another streamer
02:10
threw it onto this site called hacker
02:12
news
02:13
which
02:14
is a pretty big site um and gets a fair
02:16
amount of traffic from computer-y folks
02:18
and it made it to the top page of that
02:21
and then just a whole bunch of people
02:22
liked it uh whatever i think it's like
02:24
it's basically at 19 i think it's almost
02:26
20 000 now it's like 19 19.9 k or
02:29
something last time i looked at it which
02:30
is fun like it's so fun
02:32
and it's it's also kind of amusing
02:34
because like i just started doing this
02:36
podcast thing and i've actually put out
02:38
a couple of episodes kind of like in a
02:39
behind-the-scenes way or like in a um
02:44
you know not secret but like secret like
02:45
i've published it but i haven't actually
02:47
like promoted it or really pushed it out
02:48
anywhere i've just like shared it as
02:50
like sneak peek that's the term i'm
02:51
looking for uh some sneak peek stuff
02:53
with a couple people but i haven't
02:55
really like pushed it out and it's like
02:56
well it would have been
02:58
really good timing
02:59
if
03:01
i'd actually like had the podcast all up
03:03
and ready to go and like the first
03:04
episodes are out there and like
03:05
everything was like there and you could
03:06
click on the links and have them go
03:08
before 20 000 people
03:10
you know hit the tweet or whatever and
03:11
actually i guess probably way more
03:13
people or some number more than 20 hit
03:15
it
03:16
or saw it at least because that's just
03:18
the people that liked it
03:20
so
03:21
some number more probably saw it as well
03:23
so but which is super cool
03:25
but it's funny because it also kind of
03:27
brings up
03:28
the topic of
03:30
you know
03:31
those type of stats and like it's funny
03:33
because i was talking with people in the
03:34
office and like oh you're an influence
03:35
now i'm like yeah look at me i'm an
03:36
influencer but like
03:38
a no
03:39
because i had one tweet like take off
03:43
so like
03:44
there's not i'm not gonna be getting
03:46
calls from you know fashion companies
03:48
being like hey you should put our watch
03:50
on and when you're doing your tweets and
03:51
do the thing or whatever um
03:54
so like clearly that's not the case but
03:56
it's it's like it's a fin like nobody's
03:57
being serious about it it's just it's a
03:58
fun little thing to do
04:00
but the other thing it got me thinking
04:01
about though is like stats and numbers
04:04
and analytics and all that stuff and
04:06
where i'm kind of looking for these
04:08
things to go with with this podcast with
04:11
my streaming with whatever
04:12
and like
04:14
i i have this
04:16
interesting
04:18
to me um
04:20
take on this which is i
04:22
i kind of don't care
04:25
but i want it to be popular
04:27
but not like to make money i like i just
04:29
like i it comes down to
04:32
the motivation for me for this
04:35
is i want to make a thing that i like
04:37
and i hope other people like it too
04:39
and this kind of secondary aspect to
04:41
that which is
04:43
i want to make things that
04:45
the people who stuff i like
04:48
they like my thing so if somebody if
04:49
somebody out there makes something that
04:51
i really like
04:52
i would basically like to impress them
04:54
with the thing that i make like that's
04:56
kind of my driving force with a bunch of
04:58
this stuff i'm not i'm not in it for
05:00
stats i'm not in it for money um and i'm
05:01
fortunate enough to be able to say that
05:03
like i don't have to try and like ride
05:05
this to go and and make dollars off of
05:07
it um
05:09
you know i'm not i'm not interested in
05:11
doing that and i was actually talking on
05:12
the stream about this the other night
05:13
where
05:14
like i'm not
05:16
like if i could do
05:18
twitch streaming without having the
05:21
subscription thing where people uh
05:24
subscribe to your channel and give you a
05:25
few bucks
05:27
and get then they get some extra stuff
05:29
for the chat for the like for their
05:30
interactions like if i could just give
05:33
people that interaction stuff without
05:34
doing the money i would 100 do it um
05:37
now part of that is because i have like
05:40
300 followers or something right now
05:42
which is not a tremendous amount if i
05:44
had 50 000 followers maybe i'm gonna
05:46
have a different opinion about this but
05:48
like it's unlikely i'm going to hit that
05:51
particular number or any numbers like
05:53
way up there like that's just i'm not
05:56
i'm not particularly geared towards
05:58
going that way i don't expect like i'm
05:59
not really pushing for it i'm not trying
06:01
to grow followers or whatever i'm just
06:02
doing this stuff because i dig it
06:05
but
06:06
so if i could take that if i could take
06:08
that the money out of it i 100 would and
06:10
it was kind of it was interesting
06:11
because i was talking with somebody chat
06:12
about this and that's not a standard
06:17
response or that's not a standard take
06:19
it feels to me like very few people
06:22
these days are doing stuff
06:24
like this just because they want to do
06:26
it it's like it we have this kind of
06:29
uh cultural pressure of the side hustle
06:31
like everything's got to be hustled and
06:33
everything's got to be going and
06:34
whatever and like i've i am very let me
06:36
restate this i am very fortunate and
06:38
that i have a gig that i don't have to
06:40
worry about doing a side hustle um i
06:43
could do side hustles and i could try
06:44
and make more and could do whatever
06:46
that's actually harder for me to do now
06:48
um based off basically the medications
06:50
that i'm on but
06:52
like i just i don't have to do it so i'm
06:54
not gonna do it like i'm just not
06:55
interested in it now
06:57
five years ago before i was uh had my
07:00
diagnosis of bipolar disorder and i was
07:02
unmedicated then i was side hustling all
07:04
over the place because that's a thing
07:05
that can kind of happen there but
07:08
looking at it now like that stuff was
07:10
also just exhausting like one of the one
07:11
of the things that's interesting me
07:13
about this
07:14
kind of um arc that i've been on or gone
07:16
through or the journey right and like uh
07:19
like i wish journey didn't have such a
07:22
weird connotation word like going on a
07:24
journey and it's like it sounds kind of
07:26
like hippie dippy but like it's accurate
07:28
but also it sounds kind of hippy-dippy
07:30
so let's just let's call it an arc like
07:31
we all have story arcs right um we are
07:33
we are the center of our own stories we
07:35
have this arc that is the arc of our
07:37
lives and there's the arc of the story
07:39
um
07:40
and there's like there's the main arc
07:41
which is like you know from birth to
07:43
death and then there's all these little
07:45
bitty arts like high school that's the
07:46
arc of high school and then the art of
07:49
your senior year the arc of
07:52
you know that one class that was really
07:54
a pain in
07:55
i don't know chemistry in high school or
07:57
something um
07:59
but for me it's really interesting or
08:01
one of the interesting things about the
08:02
thing about my run through this life
08:05
right
08:05
is
08:06
i i really feel like
08:10
and to some degree it's accurate
08:13
biologically that i've kind of had three
08:15
different brains
08:16
so
08:17
my initial brain which lasted for my
08:19
first 42 years was
08:22
um undiagnosed bipolar um
08:25
i was i was a happy like so lots of
08:27
folks um
08:29
have this kind of perception of like
08:31
bipolar disorder being like angry and
08:33
agitated and like all this stuff all the
08:34
time and i i was more that than i
08:37
realized but that was not the way that i
08:39
presented i was just really active and
08:42
energetic but i thankfully i was not
08:45
like
08:46
angry because there can be
08:48
like anger associated with that that
08:50
happens i was fortunate enough that
08:51
that's not what happened with me um the
08:54
and that's actually probably one of the
08:55
reasons that i went so long without
08:57
being diagnosed
08:59
um the
09:01
then after that like so i had i had a
09:03
massive um massive i had a major manic
09:06
episode ended me up in the hospital for
09:07
a while after that one of the things
09:09
that often happens after a major manic
09:12
episode
09:13
or full-blown manic episode with bipolar
09:14
disorder is a depressive episode like
09:17
major depressive episode and so
09:20
the crappy thing is like the manic
09:22
episode lasted
09:24
you know
09:25
it peaked for a couple weeks basically
09:27
the depressive episode lasted for like a
09:30
year or two or whatever um
09:33
but so i i went from having this just
09:37
like nuclear reactor of a brain
09:40
uh with terms of energy and excitement
09:43
in terms of all the other stuff to like
09:45
major depression which was
09:48
just
09:49
and it's i i really i don't
09:52
have the language to describe
09:55
depression
09:56
if you have not had if you've not had a
09:58
major depression i don't know how to
09:59
communicate to you what that is like
10:03
like the closest thing that i can think
10:05
of
10:07
is partially
10:09
if you've ever stayed up like way way
10:11
way too long i mean like
10:13
you know
10:14
all of one day
10:16
into the next
10:18
and kind of like that that the way that
10:20
it's hard to think
10:22
like that is as is a small aspect of it
10:25
like not being able to think not being
10:26
able to move but it's so much more than
10:28
that and it's so much more
10:30
or so much less than that actually i
10:32
guess would be the better way to say it
10:33
because there's just like you you can't
10:35
think like stuff just kind of
10:39
hurts and is miserable and like but it's
10:41
maybe not hurting i don't know it's like
10:43
and thankfully it's kind of like
10:45
i don't have tremendously good memories
10:46
of it which is
10:48
a blessing right so i'm not having to
10:50
like relive all that in my head which is
10:52
i'm very thankful for
10:54
but that was so that's kind of the
10:55
second brain and like i really that was
10:58
when i really realized because i always
11:00
thought
11:01
like hey we're talking to people and
11:03
like um especially with coding there's
11:05
this big thing about like oh anybody can
11:07
code
11:09
and i used to believe that
11:11
because
11:12
i could code and i had like
11:15
all this mannequin energy and like you
11:17
know i'm a relatively intelligent dude
11:19
right so
11:21
i i just it was hard for me to conceive
11:23
that people wouldn't be able to do that
11:27
then i hit this depression stuff and
11:30
the two realizations that i really had
11:31
with that were
11:34
one
11:35
and so i kind of also knew this this
11:37
first part before which is like some
11:39
people can't learn to code or can't
11:41
learn a thing or can't learn whatever
11:42
because they really aren't afforded the
11:44
opportunity to do it in terms of
11:46
time energy space like the ability so
11:48
like the a standard thing that you hear
11:50
people say right is like if you're
11:52
working three jobs
11:53
your mental energy that and your your
11:56
mental kind of um capacity
11:59
to try and learn a new thing is going to
12:02
be greatly diminished
12:04
regardless of who you are
12:06
some people
12:08
can still do that
12:09
i can tell you i would not be able to do
12:11
that like especially now like i i don't
12:13
i only have
12:16
i then this is one of the contrasts that
12:17
is that is super interesting to me is i
12:20
have such less mental capacity now and
12:22
mental energy that i really understand
12:26
in a way that i never did before because
12:28
i because i see i've i've been and i've
12:30
lived in these few different worlds
12:32
that oh wow this is really a very
12:34
different thing than i that i got and
12:36
like it's it's almost
12:38
it
12:39
i i still i i really do consider like
12:41
i've been three different people as part
12:43
of this like still all me but like manic
12:46
me depressed me and now stable me
12:48
all have different abilities to
12:52
think to concentrate to focus
12:55
and
12:56
the the impact that those abilities have
12:59
or those the calibration of those
13:01
abilities has
13:03
on my ability to do anything everything
13:05
and all the stuff
13:07
is
13:08
way more impactful than i would have
13:10
guessed because again it's still me
13:12
but like when i was in the depressive
13:14
state like when i was in a major
13:16
depression
13:17
i couldn't learn
13:18
and i mean that like
13:20
really literally i was unable to learn
13:23
new things
13:24
i would try and i could kind of hang on
13:27
to it for a little bit and this is a
13:28
problem because part of my job is
13:29
learning stuff
13:31
but
13:32
and by the way super grateful that i
13:34
have a really excellent boss really
13:36
excellent co-workers who helped me work
13:37
through all of this stuff like cannot
13:40
compliment them more or
13:42
owe them more i guess
13:44
but
13:45
like i would try and learn new stuff and
13:46
it just it would not stick and it was so
13:48
hard to concentrate and it was so hard
13:50
to focus on something like i would be
13:51
reading something
13:53
and i would be reading some
13:54
documentation about some process that we
13:56
were trying to do
13:57
and it would take me like i would read
13:58
it five times and i would have no idea
14:01
what i read
14:04
and then i would kind of click around
14:06
and maybe get some stuff and could kind
14:07
of go forward and like slowly but surely
14:10
i could maybe figure out something that
14:12
i needed to do or how to do it but like
14:14
by and large then it didn't stick so i'm
14:16
a huge fan of taking notes
14:19
the only way that i got through a bunch
14:20
of that stuff was by taking a whole
14:22
bunch of notes so that when i would go
14:25
have to try and interact with the same
14:27
piece of software the same whatever
14:28
again i had these notes to kind of get
14:30
into and mess around with um and and get
14:33
so like
14:34
i'm actually working on upgrading my
14:36
note stuff right now um i was going
14:37
through and like ran account of them i
14:39
have 7
14:40
800 or something notes
14:42
of
14:43
some other bigs and like that's also
14:45
posts for my blog um but it's personal
14:47
notes it's tech notes it's a it's just
14:49
my note thing i call it my grimoire by
14:51
the way which you will hear me talk
14:52
about in general grimoire is a book of
14:54
magic incidentally um that is what i
14:58
call my notes app like it is the book of
14:59
magic it's it's kind of my outboard
15:01
brain um which i think is a term that uh
15:03
corey doctorow doctorow i don't know how
15:05
to say their name um
15:08
uh
15:09
said and or like coined and though it's
15:12
funny because i actually saw somebody
15:13
talking about the term second brain
15:16
um
15:17
and they're pointing to somebody who
15:18
might have coined it in like 2018 but
15:20
i'm like i'm pretty sure that term has
15:21
been around longer than that but
15:22
whatever
15:23
like without those notes i would not
15:24
have been able to kind of do this stuff
15:26
um and so like that
15:29
that has kind of helped me get over it
15:31
or get through it not over it um like
15:33
getting over it you know sounds like oh
15:35
you've i'm getting i've moved past it or
15:37
whatever but like and i guess that is
15:38
kind of true
15:40
but like it wasn't an over like over
15:43
feels like you've kind of you you jumped
15:45
around the thing or you jumped over the
15:46
thing like you you weren't
15:48
just absolutely clobbered by
15:51
the the process of having to just slog
15:54
through it um
15:56
which is what the depression was like
15:57
like i i don't um and and so
16:00
quick content warning for um
16:02
for
16:03
super dark thoughts right is i actually
16:06
had to go in the hospital at one point
16:07
because i was at the point of depression
16:10
that was gonna be like the end of the
16:12
depression um
16:13
so i went in for suicidal ideation i had
16:16
to stay there for a while came back out
16:18
and did some um
16:20
a bunch of therapy and uh stuff and
16:22
whatever and part of it was i was still
16:25
healing up from the major depression i
16:26
was still my brain was still healing
16:27
basically because it takes a while for
16:28
your brain to heal after depression but
16:30
like
16:31
so i like
16:33
that was a big part of that too
16:35
again thankfully i don't have tremendous
16:37
memories about all that stuff but
16:39
it was absolutely
16:42
a
16:43
just
16:44
like
16:46
i like i i don't know how i made it
16:48
through really other than
16:51
support of friends family and therapists
16:54
um
16:55
and meds too on top of that right but
16:57
like i couldn't feel the meds as much it
16:58
was it was that external support um and
17:01
and and friends family coworkers and you
17:03
know employment basically too because
17:06
there's
17:06
[Applause]
17:07
if
17:08
if i had had
17:11
different if i had if i'd worked for a
17:13
different organization and i'd worked
17:14
under a different employer or a
17:15
different
17:16
boss there's a high likelihood i would
17:19
have been fired and with different
17:20
co-workers there was a high likelihood i
17:21
could have been fired or would have been
17:22
fired and like that would have been a
17:24
bad cascade like that was one of my big
17:27
triggers and fears with the depression
17:28
stuff was like
17:30
i can't think beyond this then this was
17:32
the cascade right so i couldn't think
17:35
like i couldn't learn i couldn't think
17:37
and like that is that that not only was
17:39
central to my job but that was central
17:41
to me that's like a thing that i do
17:43
so like that was gone
17:45
and
17:46
when that was gone i would then cascade
17:48
into i can't think i can't and i'm not
17:50
gonna be able to do my job if i can't do
17:51
my job i'm gonna um get fired if i get
17:53
fired i'm gonna lose my house if i lose
17:54
my house
17:55
who cares at that point whatever and
17:57
like it just cascade down and that's how
17:59
i ended up in the hospital because i
18:01
would just go through that loop over and
18:03
over and over again and couldn't get out
18:05
of it um
18:08
but thankfully um through
18:11
the
18:12
graces of all the things
18:14
uh that
18:15
that was not a thing that happened i'm
18:17
not i'm no longer worried about that
18:18
being a thing that happened even though
18:20
that can kind of still flash in my brain
18:21
every now and then which is really kind
18:22
of wild um
18:25
but
18:26
to get through to this point of now
18:29
having this third brain
18:31
and then being able to kind of
18:34
see
18:36
and remember and feel the way that each
18:39
aspect felt like
18:41
and recognizing that yeah you know what
18:44
not everybody can do coding
18:47
but like
18:48
some of that isn't but that's not
18:50
necessarily a mental thing it can be a
18:51
situational thing but also they can be a
18:54
mental thing right
18:55
however the thing that i do think is
18:57
cool and like just a flip it the other
18:59
direction is
19:01
almost everybody if given the
19:03
opportunity and given the
19:06
the space like the um
19:10
like given that given basically i guess
19:11
the physical space the mental space and
19:13
the time space to do it
19:15
can learn to code
19:17
like
19:18
it is it is tricky in lots of ways it is
19:21
hard in other ways
19:23
and sometimes it's really frustrating
19:25
but
19:26
it's a thing that is approachable and
19:28
doable and knowable and solvable
19:31
like
19:33
one of the cool things for me about the
19:34
code stuff is
19:37
anything that anybody has ever written
19:40
on a regular computer
19:42
i can also write
19:45
technically like i can make the computer
19:47
do the same thing because at the base
19:50
level at the uh at the lowest level of
19:52
this
19:53
there's there's this math down there
19:55
that ends up being just a bunch of zeros
19:58
and a bunch of ones mushed together so
20:00
like as long as you can make those same
20:02
zeros and ones show up you can make the
20:04
computer do exactly the same thing and
20:06
to me that's just and like i'm not
20:09
i'll i'll get more into that over time
20:11
but just as the as the highlight it's
20:14
anything that can be done on a computer
20:19
you can also make the computer do the
20:21
thing like
20:23
and
20:23
could take a stack of work and years to
20:25
do it but
20:27
it's all it's like because of the way
20:29
that it's ma just the math that's under
20:31
the underneath there and those ones and
20:32
zeros like it's addressable it's a it's
20:35
doable um and for me that's just that's
20:38
super cool so i i really
20:41
i have more
20:45
something i have more i'm not going to
20:47
say respect because that's not the right
20:49
word but i have more
20:50
empathy
20:52
for
20:54
the for folks who are on the other side
20:57
of trying to learn stuff
20:58
and
21:00
uh and people who are out there who know
21:02
it are basically telling them oh this is
21:04
easy
21:05
just do this
21:06
like
21:08
that's not helpful like we collectively
21:10
who know what we're doing need to stop
21:12
with those words
21:14
because
21:17
if you don't know like
21:18
often times things are easy if you know
21:20
how to do them right um sometimes
21:22
they're hard even if you know how to do
21:23
them but if you don't know how to do
21:25
them and you're trying to spin mental
21:27
energy and like the
21:29
little bits of time and effort and
21:30
energy that you have to do it like
21:33
it can be harder just because you're
21:36
exhausted
21:38
like that makes things harder and also
21:40
this term just like hey just do this
21:43
just do that it makes it sound so simple
21:45
it makes it sound like oh this is the
21:47
thing it's like oh just take the top off
21:49
of this thing well i you know i don't
21:52
have pliers and it's actually on there
21:54
very hard so i can't just do it right um
21:56
there's
21:58
there's all these
22:00
implications and just that
22:03
that
22:03
and i'm i'm as guilty of this as anybody
22:05
that did not realize
22:08
that
22:09
there's on the other side of that on the
22:11
impact of that the the implication is or
22:13
the like the self
22:15
um
22:16
the self reflective implication is
22:18
basically like they're saying just do
22:20
this like it should be simple i can't do
22:22
i don't understand what's happening
22:24
so clearly i am not good enough to do
22:26
this or i'm bad at this or i am a
22:28
failure um and that's another one that
22:30
we'll we'll talk about a bunch is the
22:32
there's a difference between
22:34
doing a thing that fails and being a
22:35
failure yourself and kind of where that
22:38
line is and by and large it's basically
22:40
no you're not a failure something just
22:42
failed you happen to do it that's fine
22:44
we can work on it and move on but you
22:46
are not a failure but having those but
22:48
we don't really teach that and so having
22:51
that
22:52
just mentality of like just do this just
22:54
do that just do that
22:55
is really i think just super detrimental
22:58
to actually
22:59
helping people figure out how to do the
23:01
thing
23:02
so uh i really didn't know where that
23:04
was gonna go there you go um all right
23:06
uh i tell you what we'll uh we'll we'll
23:08
call that one here i need to i need to
23:09
figure out a better exit strategy for
23:11
these um
23:13
but like i don't know how to like wind
23:14
down from that like clearly we'll do the
23:15
after show etc um but also that felt
23:18
very abrupt sorry about that i don't
23:20
like that just like was one of those
23:22
i mean guess one of the tricks with this
23:24
is
23:25
i like if i was writing this
23:28
i could go i could go back and edit i
23:30
could figure out how to like land it and
23:31
like get it like you know hey so we
23:33
rather pull these words around and blah
23:35
blah blah blah blah blah move them
23:36
around and i should have said et cetera
23:37
et cetera um
23:39
i'm gonna move stuff around and like
23:40
we'll actually land it nicely and kind
23:42
of like have it you know have a good
23:44
exit for the thing and then ta-da we're
23:46
done
23:48
with the
23:49
freeform streaming consciousness stuff
23:50
that's a lot harder to do it'll be
23:53
interesting to see if over time i get
23:54
better at that
23:56
i know that i am better at it now than i
23:58
used to be
23:59
because i've been doing these for a
24:00
couple years but haven't actually
24:01
published them right
24:02
so i'm better at it now than i used to
24:04
be but they're still like it's still
24:05
hard like how do you land these things
24:07
um
24:08
but we'll figure it out so
24:10
that'll do it for now uh you all have a
24:11
good one um take it easy as always be
24:14
kind and we'll see you next time cheers
