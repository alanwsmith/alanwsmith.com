title: Traveling Van
---

I've always liked the idea of having something like an RV to travel
around in. Going to Bama games and general traveling both being
high on the list of things I'd like to do a little later in life.
I've always thought that the hassle of a full size RV would be more
than I would want to deal with and that something like a full size
van would be ideal. Today, I found the site
[this site](http://www.sportsmobile.com/index.html) listed on
[Cool Tools](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/index.php). The company
make customizations to vans to set them up for "luxurious travel
homes, and for many other uses". They even promote their vans
[directly to photographers](http://www.sportsmobile.com/3_photographers.html).
I can totally see myself getting one of these with or without a
lottery win.
