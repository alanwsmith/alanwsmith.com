This one's for you. 

I write each morning. Sometimes I post. Sometimes it's private. Recently, they've all been private. Not because they've been _private_. They've just been mundane. Not worth going through the edit and clean up. 

This one has intent. It's for the public. It's for you. 

Doesn't look like there's going to be much to it. Not on the surface, anyway. It's mundane like the others. But, it's published. It's putting stuff out there. Keeping the site going. A reminder that they can't all be winners, but we can't get to the winners without practicing on the mundane.

So, here's to the mundane.
