title: Upgrade Node Modules To Their Latest Major And Minor Versions
---


### Check What's Available For Update

```bash
npm outdated
```

### For Minor Versions Run

```bash
npm update
```

### For Major Versions Run

Do a one time install of:

```bash
npm install -g npm-check-updates
```

Then run these two commands:

```
ncu -u
npm update
```

The `ncu -u` command updates the package.json so that when you run `npm update` it pulls the new major versions.

### Notes

These are parsed down notes from [the official node documentation](https://nodejs.dev/learn/update-all-the-nodejs-dependencies-to-their-latest-version). 

That page is currently the third search results for me. The first two are from 2015 and 2017, respectively and list out of date methods. 

Writing this so it's in my grimoire and linking to the official documentation to give it some search juice.

The docs say that `npm update` will update the `package.json` file, but it didn't look like that happened for me. I had a version that was at `^12.0.1` that got updated to `12.0.4`, but the package.json didn't change. Possible that that doesn't matter but based off the docs it seems like it should have.
