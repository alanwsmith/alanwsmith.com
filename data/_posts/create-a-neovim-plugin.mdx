# not sure if this needs to be installed globally or just in a virtual environment. 
pip install pynvim

---

---

setup pyenv by doing:

    pyenv install -v 2.7.18
    pyenv global 2.7.18
    pip install pynvim

    pyenv install -v 3.9.4
    pyenv global 3.9.4
    pip install pynvim
    
    # and finally:
    
    pyenv global 3.9.4 2.7.18

Put your python3 stuff in: rplugin/python3


Neovim allows Python 3 plugins to be defined by placing python files or packages in rplugin/python3/ (in a runtimepath folder). Python 2 rplugins are also supported and placed in rplugin/python/, but are considered deprecated. Further added library features will only be available on Python 3.


---

echo "let &runtimepath.=','.escape(expand('<sfile>:p:h'), '\,')" > testvimrc


--- 

nvim -u testvimrc +UpdateRemotePlugins

This wasn't great

This was better:

Didn't look at this one yet, but might be interesting:

This was in some other notes, but it's not something I had to mess with once I got the pyenv stuff sorted. 


#testing adding this to `./init.vim` (note, this is not:`~/.config/nvim/init.vim`)

let g:python3_host_prog = '/Users/alans/.pyenv/versions/3.9.4/bin/python'
let g:python_host_prog = '/Users/alans/.pyenv/versions/2.7.18/bin/python'
