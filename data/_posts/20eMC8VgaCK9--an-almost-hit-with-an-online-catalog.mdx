title: An almost hit with an online catalog
---

I'm looking for a few small pieces of lighting gear. Checking out
the Bogen/Manfrotto web site (who manufactures what I'm looking
for) I discovered they have their catalog online and available for
download as a PDF. This is great since most web sites do a horrible
job of putting small pieces online, but generally do pretty well in
their catalogs. They didn't quite make it as easy as I would have
wanted though since they split their two lighting catalogs up into
a little over
[50 separate PDF files](http://www.manfrotto.com/Jahia/site/manfrotto/cache/offonce/pid/4014)
for each section in the catalogs. While this is nice to have as an
option, what I really want is to be able to pull down the entire
version of each catalog. There's no reason at all for them not to
offer this since they already have everything prepped for PDFs.
