### Goal: Figure out what I want to use for my audio setup âˆš

End result:

- SM58 wins over H5
- With Noise Suppression
- With Compressor
- Without High Pass filter
- With Pop Screen


### Test Notes

Here's the test notes:

Songs played during the tests:

- Doctor Momentum (lounder)
- Deep Mind (sofer)

This shows how much I need to setup a playlist where songs have a consistent volume. Maybe there's a way to automate that?
