00:07
all right so hello world we are gonna go
00:09
back to hello world right we're gonna go
00:11
hello world
00:13
welcome to this edition
00:15
of reverting to the old way of doing
00:18
things or at least doing the intro uh
00:21
yeah so
00:23
i don't know specifically how i'm going
00:24
to start these like i'm going to go back
00:26
and forth on these that's what's going
00:27
to happen we're going to do some with
00:28
hello world we're just on with that but
00:30
i'm probably gonna do some more of those
00:32
because it's like it's a nice way to get
00:34
into things right so like saying hello
00:36
it's a good introduction thing
00:38
um but yeah we'll see kind of how that
00:39
goes so this is this is gonna be
00:41
interesting one for me because i don't
00:43
have a specific run on this one to get
00:46
into um
00:47
i i'm a little bit tired today a little
00:49
bit like whatever but this is part of
00:51
the process of just
00:53
doing the repetition of doing the work
00:55
of putting the of putting the time in
00:56
and doing the thing
00:59
possible very possible no sorry not very
01:02
likely but possible that this one won't
01:04
actually go out
01:06
that however is not going to be super
01:08
likely i was i was actually looking
01:09
around today
01:11
for how to host a podcast or how to post
01:13
a podcast um i've been putting up on
01:15
youtube but we actually need to get it
01:16
into
01:17
uh an actual like proper podcast thing
01:20
that has what's called an rss feed that
01:22
then lets you get it in your podcast app
01:24
of choice so i looking that up i ran
01:27
across an article by
01:29
um this person named garyvee i believe
01:31
is their name that
01:33
is
01:34
does a bunch of podcast stuff does a
01:36
bunch of social media stuff does a bunch
01:37
of inspiration stuff
01:39
and one of the things they were talking
01:40
about was
01:43
you can't
01:44
judge like if you
01:46
[Music]
01:47
judge your content
01:49
too harshly you're never going to put
01:50
anything out and it's it's a it's a tale
01:53
as old as all this time about
01:57
perfect being the enemy of the done so
01:59
you kind of walk into this
02:01
mindset of like oh this isn't good
02:02
enough this isn't good enough this isn't
02:03
good enough and you end up not actually
02:06
getting anything out the door shipping
02:08
and shipping something producing
02:09
something actually making a thing happen
02:12
and so
02:13
one of one of his points was like you
02:15
know you have to like
02:17
let
02:18
effectively the audience decide what's
02:20
quality and what's not and what they're
02:22
gonna listen to and what they're not or
02:23
what they're gonna watch and whatnot or
02:24
what they're gonna consume or what
02:25
they're not
02:27
and like i think that's really valuable
02:28
but the other thing that i think is is
02:30
equally as valuable in there that wasn't
02:31
his point specifically but is something
02:34
that i've read in a couple books
02:37
uh one by stephen king
02:39
on his book on writing and then another
02:41
one um that's i no yeah sorry sorry it's
02:44
it's the stephen king book there's
02:45
another book that i was thinking of with
02:46
by a person named anne lamont
02:49
who has the concept of the shitty first
02:50
draft but that's a different thing uh
02:52
we'll get into that at some point i am
02:54
sure but that is not for now
02:56
the the stephen king one though and on
02:58
writing
02:59
is
03:00
basically he talks about his process of
03:02
writing and his process of writing is
03:04
effectively
03:05
get up every day and write
03:07
write for a couple hours and then be
03:09
done with the writing for the day but
03:11
the trick is the everyday part of it and
03:13
that's
03:14
how he has been so prolific is he just
03:17
does it every single day uh another
03:19
story that i've heard is of jerry
03:21
seinfeld who has a similar
03:23
uh methodology where
03:25
uh story goes he has a calendar and on
03:28
this calendar uh you know big big like
03:31
two foot by three foot calendar and
03:33
what he does is every day he writes a
03:35
joke he puts an x on it and then the
03:37
next day if he writes a joke he puts on
03:38
the x on that day and the next day the
03:40
next the next day
03:41
and he says
03:42
my job is to make as many of those x's
03:45
in a row as possible because that means
03:47
i've done the thing i'm
03:49
doing
03:50
on that day now i'm not going to be
03:52
doing these podcasts every day that's
03:54
more than i want to get into i and i
03:56
don't have a specific
04:00
or um
04:02
tempo or process or target for how often
04:05
i'm going to do them but i want to do
04:07
them fairly frequently
04:09
i
04:09
i think that is
04:11
good for me good for the podcast good in
04:14
general however
04:15
sometimes i'm gonna over stretch on
04:17
those and i'm gonna do them when i'm not
04:19
really
04:20
feeling it or
04:21
in the mood or i'm not gonna do a good
04:23
one and like
04:24
that's gonna be fine worst case i cannot
04:27
publish it but i'm probably going to put
04:28
like unless it goes really sideways
04:30
i'm i will just continue to publish like
04:32
i i'm already going to publish this one
04:34
like there's no question of this i've
04:35
i've talked for a couple minutes and
04:36
everything's fine like we can keep going
04:38
so even if it goes off the rails right
04:39
now still going to publish it and
04:42
eventually that's gonna happen it's it's
04:44
one of the things that's interesting to
04:45
me is the difference in
04:49
uh timing on these uh versus the ones
04:51
i'm doing in the car or have done in the
04:52
car because the ones in the car i think
04:55
generally go like 30 or 45 minutes
04:58
and then an after show of equal length
05:00
and one of the reasons i know that is
05:02
because my camera would often die around
05:04
the 45 minute mark um i tried to like
05:06
wire in batteries i tried to do whatever
05:08
and like it kept kept having that
05:09
problem
05:10
these feel like they're going to be
05:12
shorter and i think that's actually
05:13
probably good
05:15
um because i
05:16
think that in general it
05:18
fits the mood or the vibe or the
05:20
whatever like that's just kind of where
05:22
they're gonna be um though i'm sure some
05:24
will go longer some will go shorter et
05:26
cetera but so i'm not i'm not trying to
05:28
target a specific time for these either
05:30
in terms of a specific length
05:33
and and you hear all kinds of stuff
05:34
where i've heard all kinds of stuff
05:35
where people
05:36
are trying to define
05:38
like what the right length for a podcast
05:40
is um and how
05:42
you you get these
05:45
conversations that happen where
05:48
people are looking for
05:50
the silver bullet they're looking for
05:52
like what is the one true answer for the
05:54
thing that i am gonna do that's gonna
05:56
make it successful that's gonna bring me
05:58
fame riches and
06:00
stuff
06:03
but like that's that's not really a
06:05
valid
06:07
answer for
06:09
a general population of things like
06:11
there is not going to be
06:13
a specific time that if you manage to
06:16
make your podcast 17 minutes and 23
06:19
seconds every single time that that is
06:21
suddenly magically gonna make it
06:23
the top of the charts
06:26
these will be shorter and longer there
06:27
are some other podcasts to do like i
06:29
think there's one that's called
06:30
adventure zone which is some uh some
06:33
cats sitting there playing d
06:35
and
06:36
i actually have no idea how long those
06:38
episodes are but they are the right
06:40
length for however long they are
06:42
because it like it's the feel of the
06:45
thing like they get there they have a
06:47
little adventure they make some progress
06:49
and then they hit a point that's a
06:50
natural stopping point and like i also
06:52
don't know
06:53
if those episodes are
06:56
basically all the same length or if they
06:58
vary in length i think they're close-ish
07:00
to the same length not sure
07:03
we could go do some research and figure
07:04
that out if we really wanted to
07:05
i'm not super concerned about it because
07:07
again like the the length of those
07:09
episodes or the length of garyvee's
07:11
podcast episodes is
07:15
it's outside of
07:18
the
07:19
the influence of what i am working on
07:23
the
07:24
in all but the most tangential ways what
07:26
any of the what any of the length of any
07:28
of those other podcast is it doesn't
07:29
matter
07:30
to this one it doesn't matter to me um
07:33
now if i'm the car i'm writing i'm
07:34
listening to one like then it matters
07:36
because it's like i don't
07:37
want to have it go on for six hours and
07:39
i have a you know a 15-minute trip or
07:41
something like there's like ah i need to
07:43
have more time to sit in the car but
07:45
again that's just not a thing and like
07:47
you can always pick them back up
07:49
so yeah so i don't know
07:50
i don't know as much
07:52
about where this one's going now um and
07:53
this is this is one of those things like
07:55
i so i i don't there is also this thing
07:58
where like i don't have to keep talking
08:00
like we can turn the thing off but part
08:02
of this is an experiment for me to see
08:04
like
08:05
how it how like how to navigate the feel
08:08
of
08:09
the
08:10
thing to the feel of the conversation
08:13
and uh obviously it's a monologue it's
08:15
not specifically a conversation because
08:16
it's just me talking the whole time i
08:18
got it but
08:20
like what is the right length
08:22
for any given time and
08:24
for me it's like i you know i feel like
08:26
i feel like there's something else that
08:27
i was gonna say or that i had or that
08:29
whatever
08:31
but i haven't found it yet so i'm gonna
08:33
sometimes and one of the other ways that
08:35
i kind of do this stuff is i will often
08:37
just kind of talk around a little bit
08:39
until i hit on a thing or on the thing
08:41
that was kind of in the back of my brain
08:42
and was kind of up there
08:43
i don't really know what that was um but
08:45
i can kick off to another thing right
08:47
now which is
08:49
for the first time in the 20-plus years
08:52
since i left the university of alabama
08:55
there was an alabama football game that
08:56
was on that i did not watch
08:59
and that
09:01
is obviously new because this is the
09:02
first time that's happened in 20 years
09:03
but it's it's it's just a telling thing
09:06
and i know that i've mentioned like some
09:08
mental health stuff and how this isn't
09:10
like i don't want this to be like mental
09:11
health all the time but like it's a
09:12
thing in my life and that's a that's a
09:14
trick and it's going to come up and this
09:16
is one of those cases where
09:18
in the past
09:20
if there was a game on and i was by a tv
09:23
i was watching it i was like standing up
09:24
i was dialed in i was focused i was
09:26
watching it and like
09:27
you know
09:28
you
09:30
somebody interrupts me and like i would
09:32
get angry um i was trying to think
09:33
there's another sentence in there i was
09:34
trying to think of but i can't remember
09:35
what it is like
09:37
god for god
09:39
save anybody who
09:41
interrupted me or something like uh
09:42
there's some other southern statement
09:43
out there that i can't get in my head
09:45
right now um
09:48
but like now
09:49
it's i'm still going through
09:52
this transition of adaption of
09:56
not not really adaptation but of
09:59
transition of recognizing and
10:02
adapting is get not the right word but
10:04
it's the word i keep trying to go to
10:06
the
10:08
getting used to-ness
10:09
of what it's like to be on the meds that
10:12
i'm on um oh yeah so uh just for
10:14
reference so the medications that i'm on
10:17
are uh lithium lamotrigine and abilify
10:21
which are the main antipsychotics and
10:23
then
10:25
modafinil which is so the those first
10:27
three
10:28
are what keep me level um but they
10:31
sedate me and so i have my daffodil in
10:33
there to get me um
10:35
not sleepy and tired all the time it
10:37
like uh promotes wakefulness and
10:38
alertfulness um
10:40
but yeah so just this reference for
10:41
anybody's interested that's that's the
10:43
cocktail that i'm on
10:45
it took 33 changes to get to
10:48
this those those specific
10:50
pills and at the specific dosages that
10:52
we have um which again i
10:54
am very lucky that i have a very good
10:56
psychiatrist who worked with me through
10:59
a couple years and those 33 mad changes
11:01
to to get me there um
11:04
but i'm still i'm still adapting to this
11:06
to this new stableness and and the other
11:08
one and the other aspect with this
11:10
that's happened was
11:11
i got stable about a year ago and
11:16
that was fantastic like i still remember
11:18
and i will still always always remember
11:21
the day that my kind of inner voice my
11:23
inner dialogue came back to me because
11:25
it had been not there during the
11:27
depression
11:28
for a long time for like a couple years
11:32
but as i became stable again and as that
11:34
came back because one of the things that
11:36
happens if you have a major
11:38
bipolar episode either a manic episode
11:40
or a depressive episode as some brain
11:41
damage happens um you get lesions in
11:43
your head
11:44
and it those heal up over time
11:47
mostly still some scars still not great
11:50
one of the reasons they really try and
11:51
like make you
11:53
prevent you from having an episode is
11:54
because it actually causes brain damage
11:56
so
11:58
i was out of the depression but then
12:00
there was the brain healing that also
12:01
happened so when i finally got to
12:03
this point of stability
12:05
last october um
12:07
then they were in the pandemic and
12:12
i was in isolation right so everybody
12:13
like nobody was
12:15
out doing stuff so that actually turned
12:18
out
12:19
largely to be good for me in terms of i
12:22
was still
12:24
i like as i was hitting stability i was
12:26
okay with not having to do the work of
12:29
being social um
12:32
over time
12:34
i didn't realize but that isolation
12:36
absolutely became not good for my mental
12:38
health and it went from something that
12:40
was good and helpful to something that
12:42
was very much not and i and it it slid
12:45
down that way so slowly that i didn't
12:47
notice it um
12:49
but over the past while and we've we've
12:51
just recently gone back into the office
12:53
where i work
12:54
and
12:56
it was just like that was happening as i
12:58
was really kind of like struggling with
13:00
the isolation like it was
13:02
it was hard for me to think i'd kind of
13:03
phase out like i just wouldn't it was
13:05
hard to work
13:06
it was hard to do much of anything
13:08
um though weirdly i was able to do some
13:10
stuff i don't know like that whole thing
13:12
was just weird and a mess but i was not
13:16
doing good at my job
13:18
because i was so isolated like i just
13:20
couldn't
13:22
in
13:23
i don't unders i still don't understand
13:27
the one level down mechanism of what the
13:29
problem was here
13:30
i just know it was i know now it was the
13:32
isolation because when i went back into
13:33
the office
13:35
things have clicked back up and i'm like
13:36
oh okay i feel better i can do stuff
13:38
again i'm back on task etc
13:42
the only thing that changed was the
13:43
isolation so like i don't understand why
13:45
the isolation was affecting me as much
13:46
as it did other than its isolation and
13:49
its lack of human connection um and its
13:51
lack of
13:53
physical presence like because i was i
13:55
was out um
13:57
like i was connecting with people on
13:58
discord and uh twitch and stuff but
14:00
mainly discord during the pandemic like
14:02
that was my my social
14:05
um
14:06
my social circle moved to discord um and
14:08
like a bunch of us would get together
14:10
and hang out most nights
14:11
so like i was still having some
14:15
communication and talking and social
14:17
contact
14:18
but it wasn't in person
14:21
and it turns out that that there's
14:23
something about that that was critical
14:25
for me that i was missing um i expect
14:29
that is a human condition thing where
14:31
the vast majority of us need to have
14:33
that presence in that thing and like so
14:35
single dude living by himself so like if
14:36
you have a family maybe you didn't run
14:38
into this but
14:40
as somebody who was basically completely
14:41
isolated for a very long time that was
14:44
not a good thing for me mentally
14:46
as it as it
14:48
moved down from where it was good where
14:50
it was like helpful and i could like
14:52
kind of be in my own world to to
14:55
do some healing to the point where i was
14:57
basically healed and stable and then it
14:59
was like i was it was gone like that
15:00
contact was gone and that was just
15:03
bad so
15:06
okay all right so now and now we're
15:07
gonna do the thing that sometimes is
15:09
gonna happen here which is i don't
15:11
remember how i got on that track so
15:13
we're gonna see if we can talk back
15:14
through it for a split second and see if
15:15
we can run back we may get there we may
15:17
not this is gonna be a thing that
15:18
happens but
15:20
with the ice so we did the isolation
15:21
thing we were talking about the bipolar
15:23
thing
15:24
um yeah no i remember what it was oh
15:27
yeah alabam games so
15:29
i yeah i so part of part of the change
15:32
that has happened to me like my brain is
15:34
different now
15:35
and one of these changes
15:38
is it's happened this basically this
15:41
entire season where
15:43
i will
15:44
watch obama game but i will be doing
15:46
something else at the same time
15:48
and then today's game
15:51
which was against
15:53
team that we really we beat them like 59
15:56
to 3 or something i can't remember what
15:57
it was but like i just i didn't even
15:58
really pay attention to when the game
16:00
was and i kind of looked it up and it
16:01
was already on
16:03
but i didn't
16:04
care about going to watch it and that's
16:08
really new to me because it used to be
16:10
that that would like i was like in there
16:12
and watching it and just that would be
16:14
the thing but now it's just not
16:17
that thing um
16:19
and i i don't know what that means i
16:22
don't particularly care to
16:24
put meaning
16:26
associated with it it's just
16:28
that is the way
16:29
that my interaction with the world has
16:32
gone now um
16:33
and let me say much healthier
16:36
uh
16:37
both both in that particular instance
16:41
a little bit right you know not not
16:42
being super like
16:44
focused and driven all the other stuff
16:45
because like i still have focus and i
16:47
still have drive
16:48
it's just not like this
16:50
laser hot burning um i kind of picture
16:54
uh when you see like superhero stuff and
16:57
they've got like lasers coming out of
16:58
their eyes
16:59
that used to be the intensity with which
17:01
i would do things and watch things and
17:03
be into things um
17:05
the trick with that is you can't see
17:07
like you kind of miss the force for the
17:09
trees when you're doing that or the
17:10
force for the tree that you're burning a
17:12
hole through
17:14
so it's it's really it's an interesting
17:15
experience for me to to kind of like
17:19
pay attention to or like
17:21
notice these things that are happening
17:24
now that are different and i don't say
17:26
that they're happening to me i just say
17:27
that they are happening um
17:29
i happen to be the central player in the
17:31
thing but that is because we're all the
17:33
stories where you know we are the stars
17:35
of our own stories
17:36
but yeah so that's that's a little story
17:38
about alabama football and how uh i am
17:40
no longer super
17:42
um
17:43
fired up about it all the time the the
17:46
the a friend who's also now the famous
17:48
like a big alabama fan and like for real
17:50
is has said that there's about 50 hours
17:53
of football on per year
17:55
and
17:56
he's of the of the opinion i used to be
17:58
very much so i'm going to watch every
17:59
single minute of all those
18:02
that's no longer the case and like
18:03
that's it's nice it's it's not that it's
18:05
relaxing but it's less
18:09
uh it's less
18:11
requirement of energy it's it's less
18:13
exhausting i guess is really the best
18:15
way to say it
18:16
um
18:17
because that's that is one of the things
18:19
that i realize now
18:21
like when i think back through
18:24
all the times
18:25
before the medication like that stuff
18:27
seems exhausting to me now
18:29
and it wasn't exhausting to me then
18:31
because i was unmedicated and i was
18:33
hypomanic but now i just like i i have
18:36
no desire to run back into those
18:40
time periods or that that effort
18:42
spending or that whatever because it's
18:43
just like good lord that was that's that
18:46
was a lot um i'm glad i'm glad to have
18:49
put that aside and uh gotten on some
18:51
meds and so
18:54
with that i think we'll call this one uh
18:57
that that was
18:58
as is always the thing that was the
19:01
thing so now we've done the thing and we
19:02
can move on
19:04
so you all have a good one uh as always
19:06
be kind take care and uh and we'll see
19:08
you next time cheers
