"Shooting the Leica is like going out with Pamela Anderson. The
camera keeps saying you can make me clean, cook, raise the kids,
but I won't be very good at it. Though, if you let me do what I'm
good at you'll be very happy." 

-- James Russell (from
[Leica M8 Revisited](http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/cameras/leica-m8-revisited.shtml))

Even if you are not into photography or Leica's you gotta give him
props for that quote.
