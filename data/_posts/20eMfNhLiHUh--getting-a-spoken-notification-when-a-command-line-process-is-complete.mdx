title: Getting A Spoken Notification When A Command Line Process Is Complete
---

If you have a long running command, you can use the "say" command to get an audio alert when it's finished. For example:

	rsync -av /from/here /to/there && say "Process Complete"
	
That will use whatever the default voice on your machine is set to. 

---

Needs:

- where to update the sound in the control panels. 

- example of how to change voices on the fly. 

- point to growlnotify as well.
