Just finished reading my first Kurt Vonnegut Novel, "Cat's Cradle".
Pretty quick read and it's was a bit bizarre, but I enjoyed it. I
was looking for "Slaughterhouse Five". It's the one that I always
hear as being the one that I need to read. The library didn't have
it the day I was there though. After reading this one, I'll
definitely make sure to pick it up when it's in.
