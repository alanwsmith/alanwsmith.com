The progression:

- [hand coded html](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [hand coded perl](https://www.perl.org/)
- [hand coded php](https://www.php.net/)
- [blogspot/blogger](https://www.blogger.com/about/)
- [wordpress](https://wordpress.com/)
- [ruby on rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
- [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
- [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)

(I also played with [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com/) and [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org/) at some point, but I can't remember if I actually switched the site to them.)
