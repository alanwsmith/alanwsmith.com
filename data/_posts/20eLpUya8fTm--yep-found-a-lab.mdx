And we have a winner: [whcc.com](http://www.whcc.com/) These guys a
really smart. They ask you to send in up to 5 8x10s for them to
print as a test. Part of this is to help make sure your monitor is
calibrated. Part of it too is marketing. I uploaded the prints
yesterday and they were delivered to me today via overnight UPS.
Immediately, I like them. Another example of the fact that these
guys get marketing is the rest of the welcome package. There is a
very nicely printed eight page "Getting Started" booklet and, more
importantly, seven sample prints from the various types of paper
you can choose from. All of this may have cost them $30 but the
bang for the buck is huge. I haven't done anything but get some
test prints from them yet and I'm effectively already a satisfied
customer. The prints themselves look great. You have to do color
correction yourself which can be time consuming, but I like having
control and knowing that what I set isn't going to be altered by an
auto-adjustment on their end. One of the prints I got was from the
wedding I shot recently. This is the first time that I've had a pro
lab print a serious image from my 5D. I'm happy to report it is
outstanding. I also had a copy of the same image printed black and
white. They do the prints on color paper, but they have the
calibration down. I don't think I'd be able to look at it and a
print on true black and white paper and be able to tell the
difference. So, to sum all that up. I'm really digging this digital
photo thing right now.
