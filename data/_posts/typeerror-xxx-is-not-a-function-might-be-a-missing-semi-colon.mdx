When you get something like this:

```
TypeError: "output.jpg" is not a function
```

The problem might be a missing semi-colon at the end of the line defining a variable. 

For example, this:

```javascript
const output_tmp_path = "output.jpg"
```

when you need this

```javascript
const output_tmp_path = "output.jpg";
```

TODO: Figure out which version of javascript requires the semi-colons and which one doesn't.
