I'm just catching up on some shows and finally watched the first
two episodes of
"[TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES](http://www.fox.com/terminator/)".
They were pretty awesome. I was afraid it would be like the remake
of Bionic Woman which left me pretty unimpressed after a few
episodes. Good news is that with the first two, that doesn't seem
to be the case.
[Summer Glau](http://www.fox.com/terminator/bios/summer.htm) is in
it as well. I always love seeing folks from Firefly back in the
mix. So far, the show looks pretty good. With luck, it'll stay good
and Fox won't kill it.
