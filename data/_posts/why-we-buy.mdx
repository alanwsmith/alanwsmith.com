Another for the to read list:
"[Why We Buy: The Science Of Shopping](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684849143/sr=8-1/qid=1140642945/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-1506557-9535369?_encoding=UTF8)"
by Paco Underhill. I stared thinking about this book again after
seeing
[this article about diamonds](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/198202/diamond).
