Moving some stuff around my garage a couple months ago I almost put
my hand right into a spider's web. No big deal really, save for the
type of spider. Here's a photo of the little bugger after a good
carpet bombing with Raid:

For those not familiar with the red hourglass shape, it's the mark
of a black widow. Good times.
