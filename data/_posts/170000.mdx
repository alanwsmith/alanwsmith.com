My car turned 170,000 miles this morning. At lunch, the sun-roof
stopped working. Thankfully, it didn't open instead of deciding to
open one last time then failing to close. This isn't such a big
deal right now as it's rapidly becoming too hot to have the windows
open during the day, but I'll miss it at night.
