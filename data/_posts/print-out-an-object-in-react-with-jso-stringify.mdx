If you get this when you're trying to print out an object with something like:

```jsx
<div>{exampleObject}</div>
```

Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {example_keys}). If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead.

Use this:

```jsx
<div>{JSON.stringify(exampleObject)}</div>
```
