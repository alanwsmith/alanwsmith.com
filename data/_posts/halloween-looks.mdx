From the amazing Austin Halloween party.

One hell of a party. Literally, there were like four versions of
the devil there. Not that that's surprising. The cops only came one
time. I think I drank an entire bottle of Crown by myself and
started to make a good dent on another one. Good times.

At the end of the night. Someone made cookies. Somehow the plate
ended up in my hand. They didn't last long.
