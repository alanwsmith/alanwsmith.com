Continuing on the video theme, another place where video really
fits the bill is the How To and DIY instruction world. Sites like
[Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/) offer a lot of
content, but most of it is textual in nature. This is great for
some forms of instruction, but in most cases a video would be
better. [Dummies.com](http://www.dummies.com/) has a
[video instruction section](http://www.dummies.com/search.html?filter=VIDEO)
up on their site with various offerings. These short little pieces
on highly specific subjects are right in the sweet spot of the
internet's communication medium. For example, if you are looking to
hang photos
[this 2 1/2 minute video](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-hang-things-on-hollow-walls.html)
give you all the basic info you need. Finding what you are looking
for is hit or miss. Sticking with the photo hanging, performing a
Google search for "how to hang photos" returns
[this page](http://www.diynetwork.com/diy/ld_other/article/0,2041,DIY_14021_2271467,00.html)
on [diynetwork.com](http://www.diynetwork.com/) as the first
result. There are a dozen bullet points that cover basics of
hanging as well secondary advice like, "don't overload a small wall
with a large picture." The original video provides the core info in
a much quicker and easier to digest fashion and there is no doubt
it's easier to learn something by watching it being done than by
reading a description. As with the
[product demos](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/2009/01/watch-for-more-video-reviews-and-demos/)
mentioned earlier, expect to see more and more of these types of
videos in the future.

Note: While doing the searches for this post, I came across
[eHow.com](http://www.ehow.com/) which is a text instruction site,
and [Expert Village](http://www.expertvillage.com/) which is a very
interesting looking video instruction site that currently reports
having 131,537 Total Videos. Knowledge transfer has always been one
of the internet's strong suits. As increasing amounts of video
instruction are created, we will be able to learn more and more
things that on our own that required personal instruction in the
past. For someone with a Jack-of-All-Trades mentality, this is very
exciting.
