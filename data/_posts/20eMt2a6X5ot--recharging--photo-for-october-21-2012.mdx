These are the latest version of the [Eneloop rechargeable batteries](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0058GZWXQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=tioa-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0058GZWXQ). They are the best thing I've found for powering camera strobes. Super quick to bring the flash to full power and they've got a lot of stored juice. I only had to change out one time during a wedding. It's also nice to not be throwing a ton of regular, non-rechargeable batteries in the trash. Highly recommended.
