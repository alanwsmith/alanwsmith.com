The server I am now hosting alanwsmith.com on uses phpsuexec. This is a change of pace for me. I like it because it should offer more security but it takes a little getting used to.

One big difference is that you can't put
php_value
calls inside an .htaccess file to control a directory. Doing so causes a Internal Server Error (500).

The way around this is to create a "php.ini" file inside a directory and assign the variables from there. So far, I have only tried this with "include_path". One downside is that it doesn't recurse to children directories. Oh, well.
