<YouTubeVideo id="rz9_XNtAMIY" />

Today's Topics Include:

- The history of the intro and changing it up
- Working in public
- A brief mention of [Digital Gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/)
- The Workshop and The Woodshed
- Cleaning the blog
- Considering an audio bumper intro (which retroactively ended up being music queues)
- Considering a podcast episode that's only sign language
- We're gonna get into some tech, but this ain't no tech show
- The possibility of popularity 
- Ejecting 

Post show idea:

- See if there's software that would could use to make sign language versions of the podcast. At first blush id doesn't look like this has been solved though there is [this dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02351) to look at.
