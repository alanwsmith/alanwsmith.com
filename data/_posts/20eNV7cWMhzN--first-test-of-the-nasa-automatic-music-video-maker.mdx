title: First Test Of The NASA Automatic Music Video Maker
---

This is the first full run from my automatic music video maker. The song got clipped on the end. Gotta look into that. Also, I'm going to separate the downloading from the clipping so those process can run independently. But, overall, I'm very pleased.
