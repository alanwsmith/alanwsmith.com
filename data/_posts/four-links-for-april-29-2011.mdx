The todayâ€™s collection of interesting/useful links is: Space Shuttle Endeavour and STS-134

1. [NASA shuttle mission page for STS-134](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts134/index.html) - Straight from the horse's mouth.

2. [Wiki page on STS-134](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-134) - Go down the space program rabbit hole.

3. [STS-134 Official Mission Poster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NASA_STS-134_Official_Mission_Poster.jpg) - Nice reference to the latest Star Trek. Galaxy Quest would have been acceptable as well. 

4. [Pano of Endeavour on the pad](http://nasatech.net/STS134Tail110311/) - Warning, this is a java app and it launched itself to the background on my Chrome browser. Had to minimize the main window to see it, but it was well worth it. 

I made a trip down to the Cape for the launch attempt of STS-134. It got scrubbed. All part of the launch experience. Heading back down on Sunday to see if they can keep all systems go for launch.
