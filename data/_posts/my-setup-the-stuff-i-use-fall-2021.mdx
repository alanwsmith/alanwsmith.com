This is the non-complete list of the stuff I use these days:

- [Elgato Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck) - Quick way to control OBS scenes. Gonna add some soundboard stuff to it before long too (making the assumption that that's possible).
- [1Password](https://1password.com/) - The password manager I've been using for a long time now. It's paid, but I like that. The money has to come from somewhere and I like knowing it's me. I don't trust my passwords with any other method of funding. (Note that I'm leaking a little security info by saying I use this tool, but I'm okay with that if it leads other folks to using a more secure way of storing their passwords).
- [Activity Monitor](https://support.apple.com/guide/activity-monitor/welcome/mac) - The default app for seeing what's up on your mac and what's setting your CPU on fire.
- [AWS Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) - I've dabbled in a lot of services - API Gateway, Athena, CloudFront, CloudWatch, Code Commit, Comprehend, DeepLens, EC2, ECS , EFS, Elastic Beanstalk, Glue, IAM, Lambda, RDS, Redshift, Rekognition, Route 53, S3, Secrets Manager, Simple Email Service, Simple Notification Service, Systems Manager, Transcribe, VPC, Workspaces. 
- [awscli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) - For running AWS commands. Doesn't get a lot of use, but super handy when needed.
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) - Using this to automatically generate the "Open Graph" images that show up on social media sites when you post a link.
- [CodeRunner](https://coderunnerapp.com/) - This is a great little app for writing and running quick little scripts in your language of choice.
- [curl](https://curl.se/) - The amazing command line tool for working with remote URLs. I never remember all the flag and arguments you pass to do various things, but that's what grimoire notes are for.
- [Discord](https://discord.com/) - My preferred place to chat. I wasn't that into this type of app until the pandemic and loss of human contact that came with it. Discord did a suitable job of filling that need.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - I've got it installed but don't really use it much. Got some upcoming projects that will rely on it so I'll get more exposure soon.
- [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) - THE way to do video stuff from the command line. I use this as part of my process for making animated gifs to remove the black borders that come out of the Premiere footage.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - The version control system that's used by everyone I know. (I still remember `cvs` and `svn`.) I'm not that good at git since I'm mainly a solo developer, but I don't work without it.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - The online host for Git repositories. I keep most of my projects private on my machine. Or, I have in the past. I'm starting to move more and more of them up to GitHub. Taking me some getting used to since I'm not super confident in my code. But, I figure why not? Plus, it'll add another backup for my projects
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - I use the git command line for some tasks, but I like the visual display of diffs in GitHub Desktop most of the time. Way easier for me to deal with than the command line `git diff`.
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - The 800lbs. gorilla in the browser marker. I just switched to it from Safari because of how badly Apple borked their tab UI. 
- [handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/) - For converting/transcoding my videos to different formats. Doesn't get a lot of usage these days since I pretty much just watch everything online, but I like knowing it's there if I need it.
- [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - the way that I install most of my command line software these days
- ImageMagik - doesn't get a lot of use these days, but nice quick tool for image conversion
- iTerm2
- jq - Great little command line tool for working with json that comes back from curl
- Keyboard Maestro
- Keychain Access
- luarocks - This is part of what gets stuff working in neovim. Can't remember exactly what, but I know I needed it for something. 
- MDX - The amazing way to work with markdown files that lets you drop in JSX components too. This is the way of working with files that I've been waiting for. 
- meilisearch - superfast search built in rust. I'm using this for an as-of-yet-not-public project as well as the backend for the new Neovim Grimoire I'm working on. 
- neovim - I've gone in pretty solid on neovim. It's my daily driver and what I'm building my new grimoire in. That said, I'm not religious about it and use sublime text, vs code, whatever... Fight over editors is a waste of energy.
- nextjs - Just moved my site off of Gatsby to NextJS. I'm interested in getting back to something that can process stuff on the server dynamically
- node - I've finally gotten into node stuff
- nushell - I've got it, but don't really use it yet. It has my attention though. 
- nvAlt
- postgresql - My prefered database when I need a full blown system instead of just using sqlite. Main thing I use it for right now is a local django tools website.
- Postman - For API work. Though, I don't use it that often. I normally just go straight to the scripting
- ripgrep - super fast grep written in rust. 
- sqlite3 - the amazing little database that could. 
- Sublime Text 2
- Sublime Text 3
- SuperCollider
- Teams (from Microsoft) - Work's gonna be work
- Terminal (aka the built-in Mac terminal)
- tmux - Started using it this year. I mainly use it to keep my twitch chat bots running in a window I can detach from and close but then reopen when I want to check on them
- twitch-cli - Haven't really started to use this yet, but it's on the list of things to mess with. 
- Visual Studio Code (aka VS Code)
- yabai - The tiling window manager. After using one, I never want to go back to a world without automatic window management. (There's some nice UI features it has like removing window drop shadows but they involved turning off some security settings so I'm not using those.)
- YouTube Music (I've basically stopped using Spotify because YouTube Music does a better job of giving me new music when I ask it to start a new radio station from a song. It also doesn't push podcasts all the time)



- Backblaze 
- Premiere
- Photoshop
- Audition 
- ScreenFlow
- Alfred
- Dropbox
- SourceSource
- Virtual Cable
- (whatever the software is that lets you use Virtual cable with ASA?)
- Preview
- Stickies
- OBS

Other

- AWS Workspaces - A virtual desktop in the cloud. I setup my AWS account to lock everything down so that only internal network traffic can hit it and then use the workspaces (which is inside the network) to connect to what I need
- Python3 - My go to language for things these days. (Haven't done Perl in a log time)
- JavaScript - Doing more and more of this as I work with Nextjs and, more to the point MDX.
