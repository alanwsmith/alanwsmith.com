title: Idea - wireless leash
---

Seeing people walk their dogs you often see them struggling against
the leash. What about a wireless leash. Would come in two parts. A
transmitter that you carry with you and a collar that has a
receiver in it that the dog wears. The "leash" would have two
thresholds that could be set. If the dog gets far enough away from
the owner that they cross the first threshold a beep would sound to
let them know to slow down. If they keep going, they get a zap.
Would work a lot like the invisible fences that are out. There
could also be a recall button that would send a different beep that
lets the dog know to come back to the owner. And an emergency zap
that could be triggered if necessary. For example, if another
person or dog is within the leash threshhold and you need to bring
the dog back to you quickly.
