title: Goodbye Mr Wizard
---

It's a sad day for the world of science. The L.A. Times is
[reporting that Mr. Wizard has passed away](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-herbert13jun13,0,7656221.story).
I hadn't thought about him in years and then mentioned him in a
[post about the Mythbusters](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/2007/06/12/condensed-mythbusters/)
two days ago. Not a happy coincidence. Having lived to 89 and
probably done more to inspire young scientists than just about any
other individual, I think it's safe to say he had a good life.
Everyone should do a kitchen-sink science experiment this weekend
to pay respects.
