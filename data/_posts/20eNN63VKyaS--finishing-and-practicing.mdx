title: Finishing and Practicing
---

I finished something. 

For the first time in a long time, I finished something. My Daily Link Grabber is live and in production. It grabs all the links I visit throughout the day and automatically makes a blog post with them. 

I spent 10-15 hours over the course of a a few days building it. I streamed the entire process which is part of the reason it took so long. The other reason is that I went full on Test Driven Development. Originally, I would have said TDD was overkill for the script. Except it wasn't. First off, the complexity of the script grew during the build. The tests were valuable that way. Second, it's practice. The making of the tests themselves is valuable. Time well spent.

I keep going to the comparison of a musician doing scales. I never understood how valuable that was as a musician. I'm not making the same mistake as a developer.
