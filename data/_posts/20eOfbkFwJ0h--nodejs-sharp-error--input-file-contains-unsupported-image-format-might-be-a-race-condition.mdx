  An async file write was causing me issues with sharp. fs.writeFileSync got
  things working as expected.

  Nodejs sharp error - Input file contains unsupported image format might be a
  race condition
---

Was doing some S3 work where I had `fs.writeFile` that worked locally but not on the server. 

Realized that it was causing a race condition with sharp. 

Fix was to flip over to using `fs.writeFileSync` so the process didn't move on until the file was finished writing
