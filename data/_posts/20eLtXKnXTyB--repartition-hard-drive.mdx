title: Repartition Hard Drive
---

If you ever need to repartition a hard drive and don't have
Partition Magic, you can do it with a Linux LiveCD like
[knoppix](http://www.knoppix.org/) using an application called
"QTParted". Basically, what this lets you do is have one physical
hard drive that shows up as two separate ones in your opperating
system. (Note, I've only tried this with a Windows box. YMMV with
Macs.) On my laptop, I setup the one physical drive to appear as a
"C" and a "D" drive. This way, I can keep all my applications on
the "C" drive and my data on the "D". This makes organizing and
backing up a lot easier. Basic instructions for how to use QTParted
can be found
[here](http://www.help2go.com/Tutorials/Computer_Basics/How_to_Repartition_Hard_Drive_without_Reformatting.html).
(The article describes using a different LiveCD, but any one with
QTParted should work just fine.)
