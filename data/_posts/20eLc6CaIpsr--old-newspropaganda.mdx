The National Archives and Google have teamed up to
[provide some amazing videos](http://video.google.com/nara.html). I
just watched a
[United News clip from 1942](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1042724211811168164&q=owner:nara+type:world_war_II).
Makes me shake my head a little again at how cool the internet is.
This got me thinking about modern day gov. propaganda and if we
will see more of it as the War on Terror continues in perpetuity.
