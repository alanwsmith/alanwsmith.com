This is the second deployer. The first
one did some work for the transition
between gatsby and next.js.

This one is being made with tests and
will allow for easier managment of
redirects and setup to flip the
url slugs so the KSUID is at the end
instead of the beginning

Things to do:

- Move files to `_posts` directory
- Rename files appropraitely
- Add `slug` to the frontmatter of each file
- Build the redirects file
- Manage redirects when titles/slugs change
