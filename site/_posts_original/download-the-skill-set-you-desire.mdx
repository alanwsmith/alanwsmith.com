![trinity.jpg](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/trinity.jpg)IBM
has started releasing a new set of offerings they are calling
"[Skill kits](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-dwskills/index.html?ca=drs-)"
built on their
[Toolkit for Custom and Reusable Solution Information](http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/tkcarsi/faq).
The kits themselves are packages of reference information their
developers have identified as being valuable to a given topic. This
content is then assembled into a single package for easy
consumption via a mini web server that runs locally on your
machine. When I've been working in a new language or dealing with
part of a language I haven't used in a long time, I go straight to
the web and search for what I need. After years of doing this, I'm
pretty good at getting to what I need quickly but the fact that I'm
searching the open web has a few main drawbacks:
1.  It's not topic specific. Even keying in on terms to help limit
    the results, irrelevant information leaks in.
2.  It's not vetted. Most of the time answers you find will get
    solve the issue, but they may be a poor way to do it. The result
    could be as simply as a process running slower than it needs to, or
    something more severe like opening up a security hole.
3.  It may not be up to date. Technology moves fast. The answer you
    find that worked for version 1.0 may not work or cause issues in
    the 1.1 release.
4.  Only a partial solution may be presented. Problems in
    programming often involve multiple step solutions. It may take
    cross referencing several potential solutions and assembling
    various parts from each to get to the answer of a related but
    distinct problem.

The Skill Kits idea avoids the first two issues completely and if
you have the proper version, the third issue dissolves as well. The
last issue about only partial solutions being available will depend
on the depth of the kit that is assembled. Once it hits a certain
level, even if it doesn't have specific answers, it will provide
the framework for developing the answer.

Right now, there is only one kit listed:
[Project Zero WebSphere sMash skill kit](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-dwskills/index.html?ca=drs-#download),
but I expect there will be at least a few more on the way. Of
course, it wouldn't have to be limited to programming. Just about
any topic could be put into the framework. Even though there is
very little difference between these kits and a really good
reference/tutorial site, I love the idea. Of course, this could
also be the basis for building a system like Trinity used in
[The Matrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix) to learn how
to fly a Huey by downloading flight skills directly into her brain.
Just gotta figure out where to plug in the wires.
