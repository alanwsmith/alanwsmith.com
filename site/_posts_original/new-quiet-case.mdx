I've been trying to make my computer as quite as possible for a
while now. Just got a new case to help the cause. It's an
[Antec P180](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811129017)
that was designed with help from the guy who runs
[SilentPCReview.com](http://www.silentpcreview.com/). I think it's
great that Antec used him as a resource. I've been reading that
site for a few years now. Lots of really good tips in there. So far
the case is working very nicely. Someday, I still want to build one
completely out of wood and build it into the desk itself. I'm
convinced that I can make one that is effectively silent.
