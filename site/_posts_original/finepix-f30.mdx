Anybody seen a
[FinePix F30](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0602/06021403fujif30.asp)
in action. Specifically, shot at a high ISO. I upgraded my point
and shoot to a Canon SD600 a while ago because it had an 800 ISO
setting. Unfortunately, the images taken at that range are almost
not worth having. The goal, obviously, is to get a point and shoot
that I can use without flash when I'm indoors and there is average
lighting. The SD600 can't cut it. Other recommendations welcome if
you have them.
