This is bad things. [Civ IV](http://www.2kgames.com/civ4/home.htm)
is out. If I buy this game there is a good chance my average amount
of sleep will go from 6-7 hours a night to 2-3. So much for my
productivity. Maybe I should take a vacation and play it for a
week. It would be cheaper than going somewhere and might get it out
of my system. Pesky games and obsessive personalities.
