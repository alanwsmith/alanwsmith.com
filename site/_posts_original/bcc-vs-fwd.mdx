Working in a corporate environment I've come to believe there are
very few times when blind copying someone on an email is a good
idea. While the idea is nice, if the person you BCCed does a reply
to all (either intentionally, or unintentionally), everyone will
know that you BCCed them on the original which might mean you have
some tough explaining to do. Instead of using BCC, I'll just send
the original email then forward a copy of the sent message to the
person I want to loop in. Much safer.
