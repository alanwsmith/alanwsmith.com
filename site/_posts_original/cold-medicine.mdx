I've been kinda running myself into the ground with work the past
few weeks for work. My average time for hitting the sack has
probably been about 2:30 in the morning. No big deal except for the
fact that after a few weeks of that I generally get so run down
that I get a little sick. True to form, I've caught a little bit of
a head cold. Usually, I just suffer through it till it goes away
but tonight I'm going to try an old remedy. A few glasses of
Scotch. So far, so good.
