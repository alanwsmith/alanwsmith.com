I'm a stills guy. Not a video guy. It took me over a year with my latest point and shoot to actually think about the fact that it has video and to give it a try. Even longer to get the first real clip shot and posted. Today is the day. Here is my first video internet post.

  
[This Way To The Egress](http://vimeo.com/3817271) from
[Stimulating Pixels](http://vimeo.com/user1474685) on
[Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

This is the tail end of the crowd leaving Bryant-Denny after the 2008 Iron Bowl where the Tide beat the stew outta Auburn. Final score, a 36-0 shutout. Watching the fans move at roughly the same speed across caught my eye and I decided it would make a worthy video. This was after most of the fans had already filed out. Next time I'm there, I'll see if I can get on the ramp earlier and see what it looks like with more people packed together.
