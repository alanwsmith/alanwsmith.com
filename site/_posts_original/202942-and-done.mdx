Friday, June 27, the Camry stalled out on me. I limped it to the
shop over the weekend. Seems the oil seal on the distributor cap
had warn away and oil was getting in and causing the car to short
out. Cost to repair was going to be about $500. While that probably
would have kept it running for a while longer, I decided it was
time to retire the old '95. After 202,942 miles, she deserves a
rest.

Did some online car shopping over the weekend and last Monday
purchased a 2005 Honda Accord. Still getting used to her, but I
think we are gonna get along fine. Here's hoping for another
200,000 plus mile car.
