Was just trying to remember how big the original 7-Eleven Big Gulp
was and got to theÂ  7-Eleven Wikipedia page and noticed that they
now have a Team Gulp. No less than 128Â  fluid ounces. For those of
you who aren't up on your conversion tables, that's 1 gallon. Good
Lord, no wonder we are a fat nation.
