I wrote about making a
[IR-\>RF-\>IR transmitter system](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/2007/05/22/wireless-ir-to-rf-repeater/)
for eTTL flashes a while ago. I'm loving the fact that it looks
like someone is actively working on a similar concept. It's called
[Radio Popper](http://www.radiopopper.com/) and it should be out
before too long.
