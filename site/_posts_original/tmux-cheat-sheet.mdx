Note: The "Ctrl+b :resize-p -D 4" command means to press "Ctrl+b" and release it, then press ":" to enter the command line before typing the rest of the command (e.g. "resize-p -D 4"). The "-D" flag indicates down. The other options are "-U" for up, "-L" for left, and "-R" for right. The "4" in the example is the amount that can be changed to your desired setting.
