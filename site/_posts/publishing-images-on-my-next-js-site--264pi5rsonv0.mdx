Image calls are made with:

```
<Img src="file_name.jpg" alt="the alt text" />
```

The image files themselves are stored at the project root in a folder called:

```
_images
```

Files are dropped in there directly with no sub folders. 

The images are rendered via `components/Img.js` 

That file is build by `site_gimoire_publisher/index.js` every time it runs. 

The reason for the build is that the image files have to be imported and then mapped in to get them to work in the native Next.js way. 

A bit of a hack, but it works.
