![image](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/bar-code-sample.jpg "Codebar Bar Code")Between
the library, grocery store, and various rewards programs, I've got
several cards with bar codes. Since I use a money clip instead of a
wallet, I keep all these various cards in my car and only grab the
one that I need whenever I need it. A great idea I heard a while
back is to scan all these various bar codes and print them out on
one piece of paper which you then laminate. The goal being to have
one card instead of several. Since I don't have a scanner hooked up
right now, I decided to see if there was a free online tool to
generate the bar code graphics for me that I could use to make my
single bar code card. I ended up with
[this one](http://www.waspbarcode.com/Barcode_maker/generator.aspx)
from [waspbarcode.com](http://www.waspbarcode.com/). I had never
really thought about the fact that there's more than one bar code
standard which apparently are called "Symbologies". If I would have
started with the Wikipedia
[page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode) I would have quickly
discovered there are several. My library and apparently lots of
others use [Codebar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codabar). Of
course, the way I figured this out was by punching my library id
number into the waspbarcode generator and just going though all the
possible symbologies till I saw one that matched. One interesting
part of this was that I found another barcode generator at
[barcodesoft.com](http://www.barcodesoft.com/online-barcode-generator.aspx)
which is the one I tried first. Everything lined up on theirs
except the last few bars which were off which means the number
would be incorrect. So, props to the wasp guys for getting it
right. Now I just need to figure out the symbology for each of my
other cards. Now that I know that what I'm looking for is a
"symbology", I'll start with a search. I'm guessing someone else
already lists what I need to know on the great wide internet.
