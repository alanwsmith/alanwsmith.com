We have had cyborgs among us for a long time (think pacemakers) and some bionics where thought can be used to control an external instrument. 

It's amazing to [see how far the tech has come](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14790160/?wid=11915773&GT1=8506).

Still a long way to go, but it's yet another case of what used to be science fiction finding its way into our worlds. 

Here's to human creativity and invention.
