Work has been a blur these past couple weeks. 

Found out about somethings that got sold that we have to launch on short deadlines. A bit intense, but I like it. Gets me into that hyper focused state. 

Also, it gives me a good excuse to put on the headphones and close the door so there are fewer interruptions. Less having to change gears in the brain which I can do easily enough, but it takes time to ramp back up and get back in the groove. 

Serious lot of hacking going on these past few days. Think I need a little break which is scheduled for this weekend. I'll post a photo when I get one.
