title: TV Rule of Thumb

I have a subscription to the site
[rulesofthumb.org](http://rulesofthumb.org/) in my RSS reader. One
that just came up today is:
> Look good, sound good, and do something good. To make a steady
> living, you need all three. To be on television, you can get away
> with only two.

Sounds about right to me for the TV side of things. I'm not sure I
agree with the first part though. For the site itself, the User
Interface could use some work. All the links on the home page to
individual rules are designed to pop up into their own windows.
This effectively removes the ability to link to individual
rules/pages. In turn, this will result in less traffic for their
site.
