title: Practicing On The Small Stuff
slug: /posts/20enm7vgnkn9--practicing-on-the-small-stuff
---

I spent a [couple hours last night](/stream-notes-2020-10-13/) modifying a script to do the same thing it was already doing.

Refactoring, but not really. I was trying something different. Trying to get better at test-driven development. Testing everything.

The script is small. Just 100 lines. I could have written it in half that and been done in 20 minutes. Instead, I've spent hours on it. I'm not only okay with that, I'm embracing it. I'm practicing. Practicing on the small stuff so my skills are sharp when I get to the big stuff. 

I felt foolish at first, spending so much time on such a small script. But, I'm over that. It's like a musician doing scales. It's how you get the notes in your fingers and the chords in your head. 

It's how you get better.
