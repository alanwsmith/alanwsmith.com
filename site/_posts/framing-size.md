I'm writing this in here so I can find it later. I'm about to make
some prints for my office of some of my old stuff. My office isn't
that big, so I'm going to go with 11x14 prints in a simple 20x24
frame. I think that should have a nice padded feel to the matting.
Now that I have it here, I can remember the sizes when I actually
get around to giving it a try.
