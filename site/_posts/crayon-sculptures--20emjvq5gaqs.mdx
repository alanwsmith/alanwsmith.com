Sometime people turn tools designed to make art *into* art. The results in this case are whimsical and neat. 

Check out these [Crayon Sculptures by Diem Chau](http://www.diemchau.com/crayons1.html)

<Img src="crayons_by_diem_chau.jpg" alt="A photo of two small sculptures carved out of crayons. The bottom of the photo is a base of wood being held for the camera. Two crayons extend up from the wood base. They are orange and apricot colors. The bottom of the wrapper for each crayon is intact but peeled off to reveal most of the crayon. The sculptures are of two people done at the top half of each crayon. Each sculpture is the full height of the person and while there is not any find detail the overall sculpting makes the figure instantly recognizable." />
