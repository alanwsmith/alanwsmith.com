## A New Idea


I first heard about digital gardens on the wonderful
<a href="https://www.partycorgi.com/">Party Corgi Network</a>. That lead
me to these posts by
<a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">Maggie Appleton</a>
and <a href="https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden">Joel Hooks</a> which
explain the concept nicely. Here's a brief snippet from Maggie
Appleton's piece:


<blockquote>
Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse
chronological order, these sites act more like free form,
work-in-progress wikis.
</blockquote>

That idea stuck a chord.


I haven't been so excited about playing on the web since the '90s. I
switched my site over from software designed to make a blog to a some
that provides more freedom to move and experiment. I've been playing
with the layout, design, and content ever since.


But, I was feeling resistance.

### Friction


Whenever I wanted to play with an idea, I'd have to take the existing
setup and structure into account. For example, consider the width of the
page layouts. Every page on my site has the same width. It's defined in
a single configuration template. To make something a different width,
I'd have to rewire the site for multiple templates.



I've got enough experience that that wouldn't be particularly hard. But,
it would be work. And that work is friction. And that friction stops me.


Or, it's better to say that it keeps me from getting started.


When I have an idea, I want to play with it. Not work on the
infrastructure that supports it.


### Enter Dusty Domains


<a href="https://dusty.domains/">Dusty Domains</a> was a charity project
(and genius marketing play) from Netlify at the end of 2021. The pitch
was to dip into the developer community's vast collection of unused
domains and actually publish something on them by the end of the year.
Each completed site added $500 to a pool for coding related charities.



That sounded great to me. So, I built
<a href="https://jacktorrance.blog/">JackTorrance.blog</a>



I turned it around in three days and had an absolute blast doing it. I
started with nothing more than the domain, an idea, and a deadline and
turned into something I'm really proud of.



Something also clicked during the build. I realized I hadn't experienced
any of that &quot;getting started&quot; friction I'd been running into
with ideas for my site. The empty domain was a clean slate. No worrying
about the width of pages. I could make them whatever size I wanted
without hassle.



And, it went way beyond that. The software for my main site had no
bearing on what I used for the new domain. I could use the same
framework, a completely different one, or roll back to vanilla HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript.



If you had said the words "domains are independent" to me, I would have
responded, "umm, yes. and?" But, the implications never fully
registered. I didn't grok it.


Now, I do.

### I have one domain


When you buy a domain name, the basic setup ends up giving you two. One
that starts with &quot;www&quot; (e.g. &quot;www.alanwsmith.com&quot;)
and one that doesn't have any preface (e.g. &quot;alanwsmith.com&quot;).
You can serve a site off either of them. I've gone back and forth over
the years, but, they can pretty much be considered the same thing.



I've also split things out when I needed to use another service for my
site. For example, serving my site pages off
&quot;www.alanwsmith.com&quot; and then using
&quot;images.alanwsmith.com&quot; pointed to a CDN to serve images.



Again, that was really just powering the same site with a few different
root URLs.



That's been my mental model for two decades. A cohesive site that
sometimes spans sub-domains for functionality.


### Then, something happened


It was getting towards the end of the Dusty Domains and they hadn't hit
their goal. I'd seen one of their inspiration domains called
<a href="https://hawk.dance/">Hawk Dance</a>. It's a single page site
with throw-back animation. I figured I could pull off something like
that, but I didn't have another unused domain that fit the bill. So, I
decided to throw something up on a sub-domain of my site and made
<a href="https://hacking.alanwsmith.com/">hacking.alanwsmith.com</a>.


Boom. $500 for charity.


They were still short. So, I made
<a href="https://areyoucurrentlyalive.alanwsmith.com/">AreYouCurrentlyAlive.alanwsmith.com</a>


$500 more.


Both sites took about fifteen minutes to build and launch. I was
plotting to do twenty more if they needed. And, that's when the bit
flipped.

I don't have one domain. I have infinite domains.

Each one, a clean slate.

### Infinite Space

Not gonna lie. I feel punch drunk thinking of the implications.


The ability to spin up a new domain on a whim feels like a super-power.
Firing one up to play with a new framework?
<a href="https://nextjs-playground.alanwsmith.com/">No problem</a>.
Spinning one up for every framework out there? I mean, they're infinite,
so... <a href="https://every-framework.alanwsmith.com">why not</a>?



How about playing around with site designs using a full copy of the
content? Just throw some notes to the search engines telling them to
ignore the sandbox and away we go.



Need a playground to test out a CSS library?
<a href="https://tailwind-playground.alanwsmith.com/">You got it</a>.
What to practice your vanilla JavaScript? Just flip the switch
<a href="https://javascript-playground.alanwsmith.com/">and get going</a>.


That's all well and good, but what about something less practical?


Like, say, a domain for each letter of the alphabet with nothing but the
corresponding letter on it...


Fuck it. Let's go:


<a href="https://a.alanwsmith.com/">a</a>,
<a href="https://b.alanwsmith.com/">b</a>,
<a href="https://c.alanwsmith.com/">c</a>,
<a href="https://d.alanwsmith.com/">d</a>,
<a href="https://e.alanwsmith.com/">e</a>,
<a href="https://f.alanwsmith.com/">f</a>,
<a href="https://g.alanwsmith.com/">g</a>,
<a href="https://h.alanwsmith.com/">h</a>,
<a href="https://i.alanwsmith.com/">i</a>,
<a href="https://j.alanwsmith.com/">j</a>,
<a href="https://k.alanwsmith.com/">k</a>,
<a href="https://l.alanwsmith.com/">l</a>,
<a href="https://m.alanwsmith.com/">m</a>,
<a href="https://n.alanwsmith.com/">n</a>,
<a href="https://o.alanwsmith.com/">o</a>,
<a href="https://p.alanwsmith.com/">p</a>,
<a href="https://q.alanwsmith.com/">q</a>,
<a href="https://r.alanwsmith.com/">r</a>,
<a href="https://s.alanwsmith.com/">s</a>,
<a href="https://t.alanwsmith.com/">t</a>,
<a href="https://u.alanwsmith.com/">u</a>,
<a href="https://v.alanwsmith.com/">v</a>,
<a href="https://w.alanwsmith.com/">w</a>,
<a href="https://x.alanwsmith.com/">x</a>,
<a href="https://y.alanwsmith.com/">y</a>,
<a href="https://z.alanwsmith.com/">z</a>.

Easy as 1, 2, 3.

### An Infinite Garden

The idea of the digital garden resonated with me the instant I heard it.
I made moves towards it with the energy of the initial excitement, but
that burned out. The subtle friction and resistance that comes from
working within an existing site worn down the enthusiasm until it was
gone.

A fitting analogy is the trees of the black forest. They're so dense
they prevent anything else from growing beneath them. Trying to do new
work on an existing site is like that. It means fighting against the
environment. Being bound by its constraints.

But, we're not bound to a single domain. Doomed to fight against its
pressures until we give up, exhausted.

We have space.

We can grow.

Our gardens are infinite.

Let's see what we can do with them.
