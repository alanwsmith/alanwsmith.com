Themes to skip for dark mode:

- alect-black

In May 2022, these themes were listed on the page but weren't available:

```
colorsarenice-dark
colorsarenice-light
firebelly
monochrome-bright
niflheim
pastels-on-dark
stekene-dark
stekene-light
tronesque
zonokai-blue
zonokai-red
```

All the `alect-` ones came across as the same theme for me.
