I've only used it a little, but Amazon's Kindle iPhone app is a
much better reading experience than I thought it would be. I'll let
you know if I have the same feeling after reading an entire book,
but after a few sessions, I'm pleasantly surprised with how little
I consciously think about the fact that there are only a few
sentences on the screen at one time and how often I have to flip
pages. One of the best User Interface elements of it is the little
lock that pops up for a moment when you trun the device from
vertical to horizontal or vice versa. Tapping the lock keeps tells
the app to keep the display in that perspective. Without this it
would be difficult to read lying down because the app would have a
tendency to flip to a vertical display when turn to the side. One
key improvent I'd like to see is a dictionary lookup. In the
current version, you can't even copy a word to paste into another
app. Makes a real pain when you come across a tricky word that you
are unsure of. You'll need an Amazon account (and an iPhone or iPod
Touch, of course) but the app is worth checking out. There are some
titles that are offered for free. So, you can get a feel for the
experince with something like Dracula without having to pay a dime.
