Just a few quick links that I've found useful when trying to figure
out details about attending a Space Shuttle launch. (Of course, if
you can't attend, there is always
[NASA TV](http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html)
streaming on the web.

-   [NASA Launch Blog](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/launch_blog.html)
    - Note: it would be nice if this page auto-updated, but it doesn't
    appear to.
-   [STS-128 Launch blog RSS feed](http://www.nasa.gov/rss/128launch_update.xml)
    - It looks like this will disappear after the current launch, but
    new ones should pop up for each launch. They also keep clearing it
    out which sucks.
-   [Kennedy Space Center launch viewing ticket info](http://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/space-shuttle-launch-viewing-tickets.aspx)
-   [NASA list of "off-site" viewing locations](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/view/view_shuttle.html)
-   [Article from phototrek.org about launch photography](http://www.phototrek.org/Travel/STS-93/exposure.html)
    - lots of really good stuff in here.
-   [Launch info dump from sworld.com.au](http://www.sworld.com.au/steven/space/shuttle/guide.txt)
    - Tons of stuff here. To the point of information overload, but
    it's worth digging through for specifics.
-   [Wiki article on STS-128](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-128)
    - There's one for every mission.
-   [Awesome looking graphical representation of the launch before it happens](http://celestrak.com/events/sts-128-launch.asp)
    - Shows maps of where/when you can see the shuttle from different
    states. I'm glad there are people out there that can and do make
    this kind of thing.
-   [Communication frequency list](http://www.milaircomms.com/uhf_ksc.html)
-   [Another frequency list with some additional stuff on it](http://home.flash.net/~av8tor/radios/shuttle.htm)
    - This one lines up more with what I've seen in some other places.
-   [List of retransmissions in other locations](http://www.amsat.org/amsat/sarex/shutfreq.html)
    - if you want to tune in from elsewhere.
-   [My question to Ask MetaFilter about scanners](http://ask.metafilter.com/131086/A-radio-for-listening-to-the-space-shuttle-launch)
    - got confirmation that the ones RadioShack sells are speced to
    pick up the retransmissions.

These are the frequencies I've seen listed for tuning into the
shuttle communications prior to launch via HAM repeaters. These are
all pulled from the links above, but they are spread out. Just
listing them here to make them easier to find.

-   146.880 MHz (FM) - KA9SZX retransmission
-   146.940 MHz (FM) - K4GCC retransmission
-   145.170 MHz (FM) - WA4VME retransmission
-   296.800 MHz (AM) - Air-to-ground & Orbiter to EVA-Suit
-   279.000 MHz (AM) - EVA-Suit-to-EVA-Suit & Orbiter to EVA-Suit
-   243.000 MHz (AM) - Standard UHF Mil emergency Freq.
-   442.6 MHz (UHF) - NASA audio
-   AM 1240 and AM 1350 - Local station WMMB. These weren't
    broadcasting the launch when I was there, but they are still listed
    by NASA.

There aren't that many Shuttle missions left after this one. Here's
the list as it stands right now.

-   [STS-129](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-129) - November 12,
    2009 - 4:11PM
-   [STS-130](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-130) - February 4,
    2010 - Time TBD
-   [STS-131](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-131) - March 18,
    2010 - Time TBD
-   [STS-132](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-132) - May 14, 2010
    - Time TBD
-   [STS-133](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-133) - July 29, 2010
    - Time TBD
-   [STS-134](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-134) - September 16,
    2010 - Time TBD

The last one, STS-134 isn't certain yet. It has to get budget
approval. As it stands right now, either that one or 133, is going
to be the last launch of the Space Shuttle program.
