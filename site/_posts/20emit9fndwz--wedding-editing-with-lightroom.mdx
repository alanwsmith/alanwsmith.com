title: Wedding Editing with Lightroom

If you have to edit a wedding, having Lightroom with a pretty high end machine is a great way to go. 

I'd guess I spent 10 hours editing the roughly 1500 shots I took at the wedding. If I was more familiar with Lightroom, I probably could have done it in half the time. If I was also in the practice of editing a lot, I probably could have gotten it down to three or four hours. 

All in all, I'm really impressed with Lightroom. Before switching to it, I had been using Bridge and an app called BreezeBrowser that was pretty good, but I was running on older hardware and the overall experience was
very, very slow. I'm not a fan of waiting on computers, so I tended not to do to much with the images. Worse than usual that is. 

A while back I rebuilt my computer with close to top of the line components in anticipation of doing more photo work. That was money well spent. I don't know if it was just the hardware upgrade or if the switch to Lightroom had an effect as well, but the difference is night and day. Might actually get me shooting some again. Especially since the workload at the office is lightening up a bit.

In the mean time, here's one of my favorite images from the wedding.

Needless to say, it was a good time.
