Work has been a blur these past couple weeks. Found out about
somethings that got sold that we have to launch on short deadlines.
A bit intense, but I like it. Gets me into that hyper focused
state. Also, it gives me a good excuse to put on the headphones and
close the door so there are many fewer interuptions. Less having to
change gears in the brain which I can do easily enough, but it
takes time to ramp back up and get back in the groove. Serious lot
of hacking going on these past few days. Think I need a little
break which is scheduled for this weekend. I'll post a photo when I
get one.
