This is bad things. 

[Civ IV](http://www.2kgames.com/civ4/home.htm) is out. 

If I buy this game there is a good chance my average amount of sleep will go from 6-7 hours a night to 2-3.

So much for my productivity. 

Maybe I should take a vacation and play it for a week. It would be cheaper than going somewhere and might get it out of my system. 

Pesky games and obsessive personalities.
