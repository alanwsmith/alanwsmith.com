I was skimming other parts of the model rocket drug launching report and saw this under Computer Forensic Jargon: Avoid the phrase "Exact Duplicate". As defined in the [Federal Rules of Evidence](https://www.rulesofevidence.org/), a duplicate is an exact representation of the original.

Therefore, the term "exact duplicate" is redundant.  

Language is fun.
