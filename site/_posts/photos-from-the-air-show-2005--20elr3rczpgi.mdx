_Update 2022: This is from when my site was built on php. The gallery links got lost at some over the last seventeen years. The links have been removed._

_TODO: Find these images and post them again_

I just posted the images from last weekends air show which was very fun to shoot. 

Next year I'll bring a monopod though to make tracking with the 300 a little easier. 

My friend Nuge is trying to switch his shooting eye which brought up some conversation about keeping both eyes open when shooting. Generally I don't, but for the parts of an air show where jets are closing on each other at \~900 MPH you kinda have to. Even if my camera had a fast motor drive you only get one shot at these. By the time a second shot would go off the planes would be well outside each end of the frame.
