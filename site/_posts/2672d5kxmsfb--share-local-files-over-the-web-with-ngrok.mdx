title: Share Local Files Over The Web With ngrok
slug: /posts/2672d5kxmsfb--share-local-files-over-the-web-with-ngrok
---

One of the more useful hacks I know is how to share a folder on my computer so folks can grab files from it from a web browser. 

I use a command line application called [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to provide the functionality. The command I use to run it on my mac is:

```bash
ngrok http -bind-tls=true "file://$(pwd)"
```

The result is a secure URL where the outside world can browse whatever directory on my computer the command was run in.


## Windows Version

The Windows command is basically the same. The paths just look a little different. This version is hard coded to a specific directory since I don't know how to dynamically point to the current directory on Windows yet. I'll update the code when I figure that out. 
 
```bash
ngrok http -bind-tls=true "file:///C:\Users\alan\Public Folder"
```

## Password Protection

You can also add password protection by adding an argument:

```bash
-auth="username:password"
```

For example:

```bash
ngrok http -auth="alan:mushroomcat" -bind-tls=true "file://$(pwd)"
```

## The ngrok Software

Here's the [ngrok homepage](https://ngrok.com/) for details on the app. 

This is the [installation page](https://ngrok.com/download) if you want to jump right in. 

Happy Sharing,
