title: Copy And Paste Between Neovim-Vim And Other Apps On Mac OS

Add this to your `~/.vimrc` or `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` to copy and paste to and from vim/neovim and other apps:

```
set clipboard=unnamed
```

When that's in place, your `y...`, `d...`, and `p` commands work with other apps. (e.g. `yy` will copy the current line which you can paste in another app. and, you can copy something from another app and use `p` to paste it into vim/neovim)
