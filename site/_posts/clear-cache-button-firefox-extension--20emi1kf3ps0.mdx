One more Firefox extension to help out anyone who does web
development work or is otherwise interested in a quick way to clear
your Firefox browser cache:
[Clear Cache Button](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1801).
This extension adds a new toolbar button that you can access by
right clicking on the browser tool bar and selecting "Customize".
Then just find the new icon and drop it where you want it. In
Firefox 2.x the clear cache got bundled in with a bunch of other
privacy things which is okay from one stand point, but makes it a
huge pain when all you want to do is quickly empty the cache and
start fresh. This is another fine example of a relatively minor
change that's made to a major product outside of it's original
development team thanks to the wonderful world of Open Source
software. Even though it only takes a few clicks to get to the
original functionality, when you are in the middle of a development
effort you end up needing to do it a lot so the time can add up to
a decent amount. Worse for me is that it requires switching mental
modes for a few seconds. This can really reduce the thinking
momentum. I don't have a way to quantify this type of change cost,
but I'm sure it has an impact. And depending on how much of a break
it causes in the thought process (even for only a few seconds), it
can be significant for me.
