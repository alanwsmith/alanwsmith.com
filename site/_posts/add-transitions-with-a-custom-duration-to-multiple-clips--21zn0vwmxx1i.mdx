Doing this from memory right now, might not be exactly right, but should get you close

- Right click on an effect and make it the default
- Under Preferences -> Timeline (i think) look for the default transition time and update it
- Under Sequence do "Apply Video transition" don't do apply default cause that will do audio too.
