Just discovered that yet another old comic book/cartoon world is being brought back to cash in on gen-x nostalgia. 

This time, it's [G.I. Joe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Joe).

Scarlett certainly looks great, but Brendan Fraser as Gung-Ho? I'm apprehensive. 

I will give them credit for making Snake Eyes look bad ass. Hadn't thought about it in a long time, but the main comic book I remember reading as a kid was [Issue 21](http://tinyurl.com/2t9axr) of G.I. Joe. 

I wasn't a huge comic book geek, but that one blew me away. 

Snake Eyes being the main character certainly helped, but the real reason was that it didn't have any words in it at all. Stands out in my mind as one of the first times that I realized that conventions didn't always have to be followed.
