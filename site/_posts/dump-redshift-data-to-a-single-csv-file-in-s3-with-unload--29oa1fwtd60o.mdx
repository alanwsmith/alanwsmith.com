title: Dump Redshift Data To A Single CSV File In S3 With UNLOAD
slug: dump-redshift-data-to-a-single-csv-file-in-s3-with-unload--29oa1fwtd60o
---


```sql
unload ('SELECT * FROM schema_name.table_name')
to 's3://bucket_name/folder_name/output.csv_' 
iam_role 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/RoleName'
allowoverwrite
parallel off;
```

This will dump the file to:

```txt
s3://bucket_name/folder_name/output.csv_000
```

### Notes

- By default, the output separator is the `|` character instead of a comma. If you need a comma, or some other character, you can change it with the `delimiter` option (e.g. `delimiter ','`)
- To make a tab delimited file, us `delimiter as '\t'`
- The `allowoverwrite` will let Redshift overwrite the file each time the SQL is run.
- The `parallel off` is what tells Redshift to a single file instead of creating multiple files.
- As of May 2022, there isn't a way to dump a CSV file and have it land with a `.csv` extension directly. It always adds the `000` part number
- If the file is larger than 6.2GB another file will be created at every 6.2GB of size interval
