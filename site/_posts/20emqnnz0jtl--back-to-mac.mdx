After several years of working on Windows XP machines, I've recently made the switch back to Mac. 

The difference is profound and makes me regret that I didn't push for the Mac a long time ago.

A rough analogy would be switching from a 1987 [Ford Taurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1st_Ford_Taurus_GL_sedan.jpg) to a brand new [BMW M3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_M3).

I build things that run on web sites and those sites all run on [Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux). When I have to work on a Windows machine, the only way I could really do development was to use a [Virtual Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Machine) which let me effectively have a Linux server running "inside" Windows. 

While this works, it means constantly jumping through a lot of hoops. It also means everything runs slower because hardware that was designed to be used as a single computer is being asked to do the work of two or more. 

With a Mac these issues simply go away.

Under the hood, a Mac works basically the same as the servers I write code for. This allows me to do what is called "Native Development". No more jumping through hoops. No more forcing hardware to pull multiple-duty. 

Take this along with the improvements Apple made to the Mac's operating system since 2001 (which is when Windows XP was released) and I'd guess I'm 25-30% more efficient on a Mac. 

It's good to be back.
