Say you're working on a Ruby Gem structured like:

    |-- bin
    |   `-- sample_gem
    `-- lib
        |-- sample_gem
        |   |-- bar.rb
        |   |-- baz.rb
        |   |-- biz.rb
        |   |-- foo.rb
        |   `-- version.rb
        `-- sample_gem.rb

Use this to open the full set of source files in Vim tabs:

    vim -p bin/sample_gem lib/**/*.rb
