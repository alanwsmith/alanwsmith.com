Google released their "Apps" to beta recently. After playing around
with them a little it seems like they are making good progress. I'm
in a very poor position to rate them however since I very rarely
use Word or Excel or the like. It's one of the funny little
paradoxes about a lot of tech geeks. We tend to have way more
knowledge about just about every aspect of computing, but we can't
figure out anything beyond the most basic parts of some of the most
use software. I still haven't figured out how to complete turn off
all the damn "Auto Formatting" that Word does because it thinks I
want it. Anyway, one of the first spreadsheets I've done is a check
list of the top 100 movies on the AFI list. It's mainly for me, but
I'm posting it
[here](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pUE6lsTlsri8jy6AiOCTFMQ).
It's also in the newly created "Links" category over to the side.
It seems that I'm committing more and more of the data of my life
to the trust of google. Here's hoping they keep their "Do no Evil"
motto.
