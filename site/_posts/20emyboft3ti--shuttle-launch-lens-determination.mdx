title: Shuttle launch lens determination

I have no idea if this will work, but I'm trying to use Google Maps
to figure out what lens I should shoot the Shuttle launch with
tomorrow night. Taking data from the awesome
[celestrack.com AGI Viewer Launch Scenario STS 128 launch](http://celestrak.com/events/sts-128-launch.asp)
I plotted where the shuttle should be when the main engines cut
off. You can't see that point without scrolling, but it's where the
lines the head off to the upper right are pointing.

in a larger map
The other locations are the positions I'm looking to shoot from and
Launch Pad 39a where the shuttle will blast off from. By sticking a
protractor on the screen, I get the angles of view which I cross
reference with either
[this chart](http://www.sizes.com/tools/ang35still.htm) or
[this tool](http://www.sweeting.org/mark/lenses/canon.php).

Hopefully, we'll see how this all pans out tomorrow night.
