Oh yeah. Something a friend saw that was a nice compliment is
[this post](http://www.smartmobs.com/archive/2007/01/05/pga_custom_play....html)
on the Smart Mobs blog. I'm the one who conceived of and designed
all the functionality on the leaderboard that the post talks about.
I'm generally not one to toot my own horn, but I'm pretty proud of
the leaderboard design and it's nice to see something like that
writing about something you made. (Incidentally, the leaderboard
doesn't operate quite as smoothly as I would like and doesn't work
in everyones browser. But it was the first version and, to my
knowledge, the first time anyone has create a leaderboard anything
like it. Also, I provide an alternate version for those folks who
can't get all the bells and whistles on the main one. All that is
to say, that I'm going to be making changes this year to make it
even better.)
