Skimming through my RSS news reader, I came across this video of
"The Philharmonicas" playing a song called
[Powerhouse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerhouse_(song)).

It sounded familiar at first and then at about 1:10, I figured out
why. It's the tune that is used during assembly line scenes in
Looney Tunes shorts. Before the www, I used to wonder what the name
was but never really had a way to look it up. Even though I've
thought of it since then, I never looked it up. Perhaps that song
was stuck in an old mindset.
