### Notes

Seeing if I can build my own election tracker before the election is over.

Made it (with like, a day to spare). 

Used an existing feed and spent most of the time on formatting. 

The real thing I was after was seeing how many estimated votes were necessary (and the percentage) for a candidate to win a state. It was a fun exercise.
