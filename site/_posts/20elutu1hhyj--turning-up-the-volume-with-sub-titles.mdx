title: Turning Up the Volume with Sub Titles

I watched Krzysztof Kieslowski's "Red" last night. It's the third
film in his "Three Colours" trilogy. It's a French film so I was
watching it with sub-titles. As soon as it started and the first
line of dialog occurred I realized that the volume was about half
way below normal and that I couldn't hear the speaking very well.
Of great amusement to me was the fact that I immediately reached
for the remote and turned it up despite the fact that I could read
the sub titles just fine and wasn't going to understand a word
regardless. This was the clearest example I can think of about
exactly how import sound actually is. It really did make a
difference from two respects. First the ambient sounds and secondly
from the emotion in the peoples voices. The ambient sounds and
music for this film weren't overly important. But, like probably
just about every other film they are a layer to the experience that
helps build the whole. Without them something, literally, would
have been missing. Next up was the emotion in the character's
voices. Stripped to the raw text, words have much less impact and
their meaning seems much more vague. While you can put some of the
visual clues together, trying to read movie dialog with no audio
clues makes for a very different movie. This makes me think how
hard it must be to go back and read a transcript of something like
a trial where emotions are involved but only being able to see the
text. I suppose it would be like reading a novel without any of the
story surrounding the spoken parts.
