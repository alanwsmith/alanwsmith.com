There are notes on what I did to setup emacs via spacemacs on my mac (lots of macs there)

Installed emacs with:

```
brew install emacs
```

then ran this to get Spacemacs config stuff in place

```
git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
```

via: https://www.spacemacs.org/#

---

Setup to use 'vim' style in the initial setup (I don't remember the text of it)


---

Edit ~/.spacemacs


Added all this to `dotspacemacs-configuration-layers`

- org - for org mode
- python - for python to work in org mode via babble 
- javascript - for javascript to work in org mode via babble


Tried `osx` to get the option key to work as the meta key but it didn't work. 

Instead, I used this in iTerm2

Preferences > Profiles > Keys > Left Option Key 

And set it to: `Esc+`

(Did `Esc+` instead of `Meta` based on the [emacs wiki](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MetaKeyProblems#h5o-15))


---

To get javascript code blocks working in code blocks use `js` instead of `javascript`

e.g.

```
#+begin_src js
```

or this to see the output that prints to the console

```
#+begin_src js :results output
```

---

Added `afternoon` as the first item under `dotspacemacs-themes` to use that theme

(This did not require adding the [Themes Megabuck layer](https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+themes/themes-megapack/README.html))

---

Considering: changing these from `SPC` to `,` to set the leader to the comma:

```
dotspacemacs-leader-key
dotspacemacs-emacs-leader-key
```


---


Added deft for nvalt style stuff (hopefully) by adding 

```
deft
```

to 

```
dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
```

---

Set:

```lisp
(defun dotspacemacs/user-config ()
    ...
)
```

To

```lisp
(defun dotspacemacs/user-config ()
  (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
  (setq deft-directory "~/Desktop/Grimoire")
  (require 'org-tempo)
)
```

---

The `(require 'org-tempo)` was what got it working so you can type `<s` then TAB as a snippet that auto-expands into a source block

Via [this](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/11798#issuecomment-504739959) and the note that I missed in [the docs](https://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-Templates.html)



---


Removed `helm` and added `compleseus` to `dotspacemacs-configuration-layers`

Then added this in the `define dotspacemacs/user-config` section

```
(compleseus :variables
            compleseus-engine 'selectrum)
```

This is a goal to get a dynamic completion setup for `comlpeting-read` in the mini buffer to use for the grimoire (with the dynamic update it doesn't seem like there's a way to use an external search)


---

Note: installed `brew install ripgrep` to see about using `rg` with: https://manueluberti.eu/emacs/2020/02/22/ripgrepping-with-helm/ 

Not actually doing that, but keeping it here as a note for the process
