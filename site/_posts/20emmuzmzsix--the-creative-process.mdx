One blog I enjoy checking in on is called
[Get Rich Slowly](http://www.getrichslowly.org/). The blog is one
of the ones I use to keep feeding my brain on personal finance
content. In an
[entry from today](http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/06/02/closing-the-gap-between-dreams-and-reality/),
the you tube clip below is included. The clip feature the host of
[This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/) talking
about the process of getting over the initial learning curve hump.
Get Rich Slowly sees this though the filter of personal finance and
touches on the fact that this actually translates into basically
any skill. I couldn't agree more with the message. I was super
lucky to have the good fortune of mentors who helped me understand
that in order to be good at something, you have to go though the
time when you suck. As much as possible, don't let that time when
you suck get you down. Recognize that time for what it is, the
practice that is required to improve.
I'm guessing this applies to most things, but certainly, if you are
in a creative field, remind yourself that as long as you are trying
to improve, you're going to go through gap times and that's just
part of gig.
