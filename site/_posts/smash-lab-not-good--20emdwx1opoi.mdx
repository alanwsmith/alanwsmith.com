Discovery channel has a new show called "Smash Lab" that's in the
same genre as "Mythbusters". Watched what I think is the first
episode on the DVR tonight and I'm highly disappointed. The tag
lines in one of their ads is that you can tell your friends you are
watching it for the science, but we know why you are really
watching it. The implication being that the real reason is to see
all the stuff that gets blown up, smashed or otherwise destroyed
that you see in the underlying video. The problem here is that
their science is poor. In the episode I watched, the cast were
testing two methods to see if aerated concrete could be helpful in
preventing cars from traveling across a highway median into
oncoming traffic. The first thing they did was to gather some
control data where they rammed one car at 60 miles an hour into
five other stationary ones to simulate a highway crash. Big problem
here is that unless it's gridlocked on the other side (which is not
what they said they were testing) the cars on the other side of the
road would be moving as well. At another point, they were trying to
see if a bed of the concrete would crumble enough underneath a car
to slow it down before it entered oncoming traffic. In their
original setup they defined the average highway median as being
about six feet. For their aerated concrete bed though, they had
what I'm guessing was about 150 feet. Even crossing at an angle
this is way more than they originally defined. Not to mention that
when the car shot all the way through it, they thought that it was
maybe because it was too light so they decided to use a bus. Once
again, moving away from the original purpose of keeping a CAR from
crossing into oncoming traffic. There were a few other things too,
but you get the idea. All this doesn't even touch on the
over-intense, suspenseful feeling they try to get going including
some thumping heart-beat background music when they are building up
to test. I'm all about showing neat sides of science, but when it
feels like an over acted nickelodeon show and they present crappy
science, that's a disservice to just about everybody.
