Well, they have been talking about it for some time, but
[according to this article RFID chips will be in passports starting a year from now](http://news.com.com/Passports+to+get+RFID+chip+implants/2100-7348_3-5913644.html?part=rss&tag=5913644&subj=news).
So, if you are paranoid like me, go get your passport renewed now.
If you don't have one, go ahead a get one. Never no when you might
need to flee the country.  
Favorite line: Out of the 2,335 comments on the plan that were
received by the State Department this year, 98.5 percent were
negative.  
Good to know our law representatives are representing.
