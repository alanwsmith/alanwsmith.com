For all you hackers out there who are into finance, if you want a data feed of stock info, check out Yahoo Finance's [stock quotes](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=yhoo). 

On that page you will find a "[download data](http://finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=YHOO&f=sl1d1t1c1ohgv&e=.csv)" link that provides a .csv file with some basic price info. 

Very handy. 

If you browse around their site, there are other places that also have download links. Kudos to Yahoo for providing raw data.
