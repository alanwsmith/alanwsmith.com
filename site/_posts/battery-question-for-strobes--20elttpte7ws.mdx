For those photographers out there: Do y'all use regular alkaline AAs, rechargeable AAs, or a pack?

I used to use a pack for most things, but I'm thinking about switching over to rechargeables AAs.

Way lighter and less expensive. I don't need super fast recharging, but I'm wondering about cycle times. Any ideas?

Update: November, 2021

I've been using [Eneloop Pro AA batteries](https://www.amazon.com/eneloop-K-KJ75KHC4BA-Panasonic-Rechargeable-Batteries/dp/B07JZZDWLL/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=eneloop+pro&qid=1637807334&sr=8-4) for years. They cycle flashes super fast and last a long time on each charge. It's been a while since I've looked at the batter market to see if there's anything better, but I wouldn't be surprised to find these are still at the top of the pack.
