title: No more spell checking emails
slug: /posts/20em4qnhrn13--no-more-spell-checking-emails
---

The email program I use at work doesn't have an inline spell
checker. If you want to do a spell check, you have to click on a
button and wait for it to go thru the message and pull up
individual words that it finds that it thinks are wrong. While it's
not THAT time consuming, the process probably takes a minute for
short emails and two or a little more for longer ones. Aside from
the time, it also really disrupts the "flow" of working. So, I'm
pretty much going to stop doing spell checks. By and large the
message should be understandable even with a few typos.
