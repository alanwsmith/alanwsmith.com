I just discovered that the free
[IrfanView](http://www.irfanview.com/) image software can make
favicon.ico files. These are the little icons often show up that
show up on web sites in the address bar or when you bookmark them.
[Earlier](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/2008/03/30/favorite-icons/),
I had pointed to an online tool that does this, but I prefer local
software for this type of thing so this is a very nice discovery.
