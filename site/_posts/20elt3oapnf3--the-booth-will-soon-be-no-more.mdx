This sucks. I heard a couple of weeks ago that The Booth is
closing. I frequented a fair number of the bars in Tuscaloosa, but
The Booth was far and away the one I considered "mine". For a
while, I was playing there just about every weekend with Hillside
Harmony. Not to mention that I probalby sat in with a dozen other
bands there including the first time I jammed with Planet Jive. I
figured that bar would be one of the ones that stayed around
forever while others came and went around it. Probably would have
happend too, but it seems that the building got sold out from under
them. Here's
[an article](http://tledit.us.publicus.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060915/TUSK02/60914014/-1/tusk)
about it. I can understand it if a bar just looses it's clientel or
the management blows it and the bar goes under, but this is a crap
way to go out. One my short list of "if I won the lottery" items
is: Move open a bar in Tuscaloosa and bring in as much live music
as I can. With the closing of The Booth, that goal just got a
little higher on my list.
