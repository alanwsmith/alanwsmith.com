This is an older article that I just saw by a guy named
[Ken Rockwell](KenRockwell.com). It's called
[How to Become a Professional Photographer](). It's long, but worth
a read if you are in early stages of considering starting just
about any business. He talks a lot about how the important part of
running a photography business is the actual business side rather
than the photography side. Also, about how important sales and
marketing are. I've thought off and on since I probably about that
time I first picked up a camera about having a photography
business. I've worked directly for a few photographer and with a
bunch more and freelanced myself for a while. From everything I've
seen, the article pretty well nails it. Perhaps my favorite quote
is up towards the top:
> Would you like to photograph anything you want, anywhere you want,
> anytime you want, any way you want, with a great professional
> camera system? Would you love to travel to luxury destinations and
> photograph whatever, whenever you want? The only way to do this is
> to keep your real job and do photography on your own time.

I haven't been shooting much recently, but I couldn't agree more.
