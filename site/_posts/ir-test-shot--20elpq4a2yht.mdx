Just got the IR converted camera back at lunch today. I walked outside and took a couple of test images. Here's one:

My chrome that I'm going to use for the flash filter isn't in yet, but should be this week. So, still need a few parts to get the system I've envisioned together but the key part is in play. I'm very psyched.
