I've said before that even if I'm not into something at all, I
pretty much always like seeing examples of excellence in any
category. Some folks I've met aren't like this. If something is
outside of their normal orbit, they aren't interested or aren't
willing to think about what it takes to excel. Thanks to the good
ol' net, we can be exposed to excellence we would likely have never
seen before. (Assuming it gets found in all the crap.) Take for
example, hand clapping. It wouldn't have occurred to me to think
about excellence in that field. Glad I followed the link to
[this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNXElmEUIJo) just to see it
though. Of course, I think it's easier to appreciate excellence in
something that we can all understand or do. I can clap, but I sure
can't do it like that guy. I don't have any desire to, but I'm
still happy I saw it. I'm sure a ton of folks will make fun of the
guy and the video, but mocking is easy.
