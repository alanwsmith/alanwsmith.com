We've been having a monsoon here in Florida over the past few days. This morning, I had to go to a meeting in another building. It was less than 200 yards away so we walked. I had an umbrella, but the rain was coming down so hard that it was bouncing up so much that by the time I got to the meeting, my pants were
completely soaked up to about my knees. 

So, I got to sit in a six hour meeting with wet socks. 

Not so much fun.
