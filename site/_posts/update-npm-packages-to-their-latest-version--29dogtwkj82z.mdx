The yolo way to do it is:

```bash
npx npm-check-updates -u
npm i
```

the `npx npm-check-updates -u` updates the `package.json` file with all the latest versions (including major version changes)

then, running `npm i` does the install of all those latest modules from the `package.json` file

If you just want to do a single package, do:

```
npm install PACKAGE_NAME@latest
```
