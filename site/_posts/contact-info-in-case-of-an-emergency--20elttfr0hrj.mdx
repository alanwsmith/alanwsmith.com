Here's a good use of technology. Florida has a system in place now
where you can go to this page and virtually add emergency contact
info to your driver's license. You simply input the info on the
site and if you are in an accident the rescue folks can call in
your driver's license ID and get the contact info. Of course, there
is a chance that this info will be leaked, hacked, or accidently
publised on a web site, but it's probably worth it. Apparently,
rescue workers also look on cell phones for any ICE (in case of
emergency) listings. This probably isn't universal, but it would
hurt to have an entry like "I.C.E. - Mom" in your cell phone.
