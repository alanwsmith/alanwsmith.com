Found this one on [boingboing](https://boingboing.net/). 

A "wire artist". 

I literally laughed out loud a few times. 

This one is called "Rejection".

The hotdog has its arms in a gesture of pleading. The bun is turned away from the hotdog with its arm and hand extended in a stop gesture and a general I don't want to hear it vibe" />

Update 2022: The original site was on blogspot. It's done, but I found the source. These are from Terry Border and are part of their [Bent Objects](https://www.terryborder.com/bentobjectspage1). There's not many Bent Objects posted, but their site has a bunch of other fun stuff to check out at [terryborder](https://www.terryborder.com/)
