(originally posted on: http://alancode.blogspot.com/)

I ran a couple a search for the a tag a couple of times and got nothing, but just returned a hit. Looks like the theory was sound. It took about 30 min. in this case. Could be that I hit it at just the right or just the wrong time, but my guess is that within an hour or so the tags on new posts would be available.

Now, what to do with this you ask? One option would be to create URLs in the sidebard that call the tags. I'm going to setup a couple of those shortly and will add to them over time.

I haven't messed with the feeds to much yet, but it should also be pretty easy to setup a little script that gives you a list of all the tags you have. Probably won't be able to run this on blogspot itself, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.
