Did another photo workshop a few weeks ago. Just now getting to the
edit stage. Here's one of the first ones of a model named
Stephanie.

I really need to get back into using photoshop. Touch ups, contrast
adjustment and color ballance are taking me forever. If I do much
more of this stuff, I'm going to have to actually color balance my
monitor too. Right now, I struggle to keep from just saying to hell
with it and converting everything to black and white or a sepia
tone.
