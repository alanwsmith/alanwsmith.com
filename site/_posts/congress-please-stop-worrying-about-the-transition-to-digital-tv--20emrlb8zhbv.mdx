Dear Congress, Now that you have gone through it again and
[decided not to push back the date for the transition to DTV](http://techfragments.com/news/331/Tech/Digital_TV_Transition_Delay_Bill_Failed_to_Pass.html),
please drop the matter. No matter what you do, such a fundamental
change is going to cause issues that piss people off. Better to go
ahead and get it over with. Plus, you have much more important
stuff to be worrying about.
