I'm pretty impressed with the camera on the iPhone 3GS. 

Here's a snap.

All I did to this was crop a little to straighten the image, resize down to 550 pixels wide and then apply "Smart sharpen" in Photoshop.

Pretty damn good quality considering it's a tiny camera on a cell phone. 

Also, the wind was blowing a little so the blooms were moving a decent amount. It was bright enough that the action was stopped pretty well.
