After eleven years and 165,000 miles worth of locking and
unlocking, the remote for my cars alarm is about to give up the
ghost. I changed the batter, but that wasn't it, but switch itself
seems to be wearing out. Since I don't want the last thing it does
to be to arm the alarm, I've stopped using it and have reverted to
the old fashion key. The lock hasn't really had any exercise in
years so it was a little resistent at first. The design itself is
nice. When you turn the key clockwise it locks all four doors on
the car. The first rotation counter-clockwise unlocks just the
driver door and a second turn unlocks the rest of the doors. Not
that big a deal, and most cars probably do the same thing, but it's
one of those little detail refinements that means that someone was
really thinking about it.
