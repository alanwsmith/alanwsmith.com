If you don't have it, get backup software. Let me say that again.
Get backup software. If you still don't have it, set a deadline
before you go back to work on Monday. It's not a question of "If"
your hard drive will fail, it's a question of "When". And when it
happens you are going to want to have a copy of the stuff that was
on it somewhere you can still use it. Business documents, your
thesis, all you digital photos, whatever... There is stuff on there
that you want to keep forever and your hard drive is probably
already out of warranty. So, get some backup software. An important
point is that you want to make sure that you are backing up your
stuff somewhere other than the main hard drive in your computer. It
doesn't do you a lot of good to have a backup copy of things on the
same disk if the entire disk decides to stop letting you get to
files on it. There are a few options for your external backup
location. The basic ones are: - An second or external hard drive. -
A hard drive on another computer in your house. - A network backup
place on the internet. - CD/DVDs I would recommend against the
CD/DVD options since that means you would have to load a new blank
disk each time you wanted to backup. The goal is to get it
automated so you don't have to think about it. The software I use
is [Second Copy](http://www.centered.com/). It's quick and easy to
install and setup. It's $30. I may switch to an open source one
someday, but I haven't seen any reviews of one that I trust. For a
while I was working with one that I wrote, but I figure when it
comes to backups, it's worth $30. After all, all my digital photos
are way more valuable than that to me.
