title: Quick Access To the Emoji Keyboard On A Mac

I get quick access to emojis on my mac by adding the "Input Menu" to the top level menu bar by going to:

System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources 

Then ticing the checkbox for "Show Input menu in menu bar"

A new icon will appear with drop down links to:

- Show Emoji &amp; Symbols
- Show Keyboard Viewer
- Open Keyboard Preferences

Super convenient.
