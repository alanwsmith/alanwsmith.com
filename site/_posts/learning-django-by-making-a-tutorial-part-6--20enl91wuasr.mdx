### [Start: 00:00:00] - Going through the tutorial so far to make sure it works

Just walking through the tutorial in its current state to see how it's going. 

Made a few adjustments. That processes will continue, but it's shaping up nicely. 


### [Time: 1:06:30] - Adding URLs

This went pretty quick. It was also another example of being able were I was able to figure stuff out making my own tutorial that I hadn't doing the official one. In this case, it was namespacing URLs. 

After doing the URLs, I've decided the next step will be setting up templates. That feels like a natural progression and will make the site look decent. From there, I'll move on to the database stuff. 

Shoutout to [xprotocol_](https://www.twitch.tv/xprotocol_) for stopping by.
