title: Securing WordPress for SSL admin
slug: /posts/20emodmeswtb--securing-wordpress-for-ssl-admin
---

I've written before about how WordPress doesn't really have a way
to allow you to put administration tools in a secure location
unless you do the same thing with the entire blog. This concerns me
since I'm often on a wireless network that is open and not mine.
Say, for example, at a book store with free wireless. While surfing
on an open wireless network is generally pretty benign, sending any
username/password across it without them being secure/encrypted
makes it very easy to steal them.

I've hunted around a few times before, but had never really found a
good solution. While doing some work on my site, I decided to try
again and this time came up with
"[Admin-SSL](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/admin-ssl-secure-admin/)".
It's a plug-in someone wrote for WordPress that allows you to move
all the "admin" stuff to a secure location. Something that isn't
possible with the default install of WordPress (where you are
either all secure or all open).

There are two examples of the power and benefit of open-source
software with this plug-in. First off is the basic fact that
WordPress is open which allowed for the plug-in to be created in
the first place. While this isn't limited to open source software,
it's a big help.

Second, when I installed the plug-in on my site, it didn't work
properly. Some of the software that runs my site is different where
the plug-in was originally created. However, since I could look at
the source code, I was able to find a fix that works and allows me
to use the it. To contribute back to the overall community a
little, I've sent a note back to the original author explaining
what I ran into and how I fixed it. This gives him the opportunity
to let other people know about the issue and a way to fix it.
Possibly even creating a specific fix for the issue in the next
version.

Stop reading.... unless you are a web geek and/or are specifically
looking for a fix for Admin-SSL on version 1.3 of the Apache web
server. Below are the details of the fix that works for me. YMMV.

First, the short and sweet fix to try:

> When you configure Admin-SSL (at least version 1.1) on a server
> running Apache 1.3, under the "Other Settings" category and the
> "HTTPS Detection" section
> 
> change: "The name of the HTTPS $\_SERVER variable"   
> to: "SERVER\_PORT" (without the quotes)
> 
> and change: "The value of the HTTPS $\_SERVER variable when HTTPS
> is ON"   
> to: "443" (again, without the quotes)

Now some details. Admin-SSL uses the predefined $\_SERVER\['HTTPS'\]
php variable to check for secure connections while pattern matching
to see if it should redirect a page to a protected URL. While this
variable is available in Apache 2.x it is not in the Apache 1.3.x
versions of the server.

See the list of "specials" under the "RewriteCond Directive" for
reference:   
Apache 2.x -
[http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod\_rewrite.html\#rewritecond](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewritecond "http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewritecond")
  
Apache 1.3 -
[http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod\_rewrite.html\#RewriteCond](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html#RewriteCond "http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html#RewriteCond")

You can use an existing feature in the Admin-SSL configuration
(described above) to get around this limitation assuming the port
that your host uses for SSL is different from. Usually, SSL is set
to run on port "443". If your provider uses a different port, you
can simply use that instead. The only exception to this is if you
have a host that runs both HTTP and HTTPS over the same port. In
that case, there is no way to tell the difference in the script
using the above method.

All this, of course, assumes that your host provides you with a way
to access your site via HTTPS with either a private or shared cert.
A general practice is for them to setup URLS like:

"https://www.your-site.com/~your-username/" that would simply give
you a secure version of "http://www.your-side.com/". If you don't
see a colon followed by a number after the .com, you should be
running on 443. If you see something like
"https://www.your-site.com:1234/~your-username/", that means
that your host is running HTTPS on port "1234", or whatever the
number there is. That's the number you would want to configure.

If, for some strange reason, that number is "80", you're going to
have to fins another solution, because that's the standard port for
web traffic which means the script wouldn't be able to tell the
difference.
