When I used to think of the dictionary folks at Merriam-Webster a
scene of an refined, well kept library came to mind. A high class
organization with the sole focus of keeping our lexicon. I used to
user their online dictionary all the time but moved to either
dictionary.com or tfd.com. Today, I was doing a quick comparison
using m-w.com again and was remined of one of the reasons why I
switched. After looking up the word, I noticed that I got a
pop-under ad (the kind that you might not notice until you close
your main browser window). This is despite the fact that I use
Firefox and have it setup to kill all those types of ads. This
means that not only is Merriam-Webster using pop-unders, which are
one of my least favorite types of ads, but they are specifically
working around pop-up blockers. For a mainstream (not porn)
website, that's about as low class as you can get.
