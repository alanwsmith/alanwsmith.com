Dec. 27, 2020

I turned my mac's dates and clock off. It's kinda disconcerting to realize how much I look for it. Like, it was no time at all when I realized I was checking for it but it wasn't there. 

I'm still setup with a clock on the windows machine beside the mac. So, it's okay. Just gotta get used to it.

The reason I turned them off was so that the videos I record don't have them. I want them to be timeless. Same reason I'm always wearing a black polo and will always wear the same glasses. I want there to be as little distraction from the content as possible. I want for me and everything else besides the topic to fade into the background. (Yes, I will date some of them when appropriate.)

The other thing I just did was move the resolution of my mac go 1280x720. The fonts are huge. It's not awful because I've moved the monitor twice as far away from me as I generally have it. Again, this is to make the videos look as good as possible. I'd like to see if I can get them working on phones. Or, I mean, that I can get the fonts readable on phones. I did some tests a while ago and I think I can do it, but I just did another one where I scripted going through a bunch of different font sizes. Creating the script was a video in and of itself. 

I also re-arranged the office today. Partly because my mac was freaking out and I think it's maybe because I had it on my speaker. That doesn't totally make sense other than the only that that changed recently was that I moved it on the speaker in a way that put it more over the magnet. So, who knows. 

It bummed me out for a bit when I thought I wouldn't be able to record any more videos until I got a new one and that would probably take longer than the week vacation I have left. 

But, so far so good.
