My passion for photography recently reignited. To further fuel the flame, I'm attending Photoshop World<sup>1</sup> this week. On Tuesday, I attended the "Canon Live Shoot" workshop that's part of the conference. It looked like a great opportunity to watch top pros teach and learn a little something. It did not disappoint. 

The instructors were Jack Reznicki<sup>2</sup>, Eddie Tapp<sup>3</sup> and Steve Inglima<sup>4</sup>. I spent the majority of the shooting session in Steve's group. Of course, I took the opportunity to shoot a little behind the scenes shot with my Canon S100<sup>5</sup> point and shoot.

Steve was a great teacher. He did a fantastic job of working with all the photographers and  our model Michelle. Part of the workshop included a competition where the entire Photoshop World audience picked the best photo from the day's shoot. One of the images Steve setup won. Sadly, it wasn't my image, but I'm still happy with my shot.

Anyone familiar with DK's<sup>6</sup> work will easily be able to tell he's been my mentor for the past couple of decades.

_Links and Notes_

1. [Photoshop World](http://photoshopworld.com) - Best decision I've made is long time was deciding to come to this event. I've been largely out of the game for a long time. I'm still way behind, but I learned more in the past couple of days than I would have been able to on my own in months and there's still one day to go. Aside from the Photoshop stuff, it's also been great to see some of the best at work. My mind won't stop racing with ideas for things I want to shoot and ways I want to shoot them.

2. [Jack Reznicki](http://reznicki.com) - Teacher and commercial shooter. I didn't get to spend as much time working with him as I would have liked, but really enjoyed his part of the presentation.

3. [Eddie Tapp](http://eddietapp.com/blog/) - Eddie gave the post processing part of the presentation. This marked the start of my entrance back into the world of photoshop. I'm already seeing benefits from the notes from his talk.

4. Steve Inglima - I'm not finding a personal web site for Steve. Perhaps Vegas has blunted my Google skills. One thing I know he does is Canon's [Explorers of Light program](http://learn.usa.canon.com/explorers_of_light/eol_home.shtml). Something I've enjoyed for years.

5. [Canon PowerShot S100](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005MTME3U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005MTME3U&linkCode=as2&tag=tioa-20) - This is the point and shoot that I carry and recommend.

6. [Dennis Keim](http://www.dk-studio.com/) - My friend, mentor and all around great dude.
