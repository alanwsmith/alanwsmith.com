This spider was hanging (get it) outside my office window for a few days. I haven't taken the time to figure out the type, but I've always heard that when you see a bright red mark on something in nature, you're best to steer clear. Of course, it looks cool so I got super close to get a photo. This was also show with my little Canon S100. That camera is fantastic.
