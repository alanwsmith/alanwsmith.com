I've been traveling a ton recently. Mostly my trips were work
related. Jumping back and forth to Atlanta for a few days at a
time. Last week I took a trip out to Las Vegas to help out with
another Supershoots.com workshop. Once again, it was a ton of fun.
Lots of shooting, a substantial amount of drinking, some gambling
and very little sleep. While in Vegas, I discovered that roulette
is my game. It was my first trip to Vegas and my first time playing
roulette and both turned out great. I was up a max of about $200
during the trip. Ended up loosing some of that, but still managed
to leave $100 on the plus side. I'm not really a gambler at all,
but that was a lot of fun. After returning from Vegas late Tuesday
night, I went to work on Wed. and then flew out again on Thursday.
This time to Birmingham with the ultimate destination of
Tuscaloosa, Alabama. C.J. and I have been trying to make it back to
a Bama game for a few years, but could never get our schedules to
line up. This year, we finally said, "screw it, we're going no
matter what" and got tickets to the Bama vs Tennessee game. I don't
think Bama beat Tennessee in Tuscaloosa at any of the games I went
to while in school. I'm happy to report we beat the crap out of
them 41-17 this go round. It was beautiful football weather and a
beautiful game. Ended up being a great game to make our return.
