The basic SQL statement to build a table in postgres

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.states (
    db_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    abbreviation VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    full_name VARCHAR(30)
);

ALTER TABLE public.states ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

The `ALTER TABLE public.states ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;` is important for things like supabase. Without, anonymous connections to read from and write to the table

These are the old notes that I don't think are right. it may be an alternate way to do it, but that need to be investigated.


TODO: put in link to how to setup privilidges

login with:

```
psql -d database_name -U role_name
```


Example:

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_name.new_table_name (
    code        char(5) CONSTRAINT firstkey PRIMARY KEY,
    title       varchar(40) NOT NULL,
    did         integer NOT NULL,
    date_prod   date,
    kind        varchar(10)
);
```

Do row level security (e.g. on supabase) with:

```sql
ALTER TABLE schema_name.new_table_name ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```
