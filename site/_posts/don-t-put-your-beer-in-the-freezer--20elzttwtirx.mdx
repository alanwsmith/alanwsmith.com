Or, this might happen:

<Img src="beer_bottle_in_a_freezer_with_the_top_missing_and_frozen_beer_leaking_out_20060205_222340a.jpg" alt="A beer bottle in a freezer next to a bag of ice. The top of the beer bottle is missing and frozen beer foam has expanded out and overflowed down the side of the bottle" />

Of course, I don't drink beer so this is unlikely to happen to me. And whiskey doesn't freeze (or explode) in your average freezer.
