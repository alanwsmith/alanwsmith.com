While hanging out at a friend's family place over fourth of july, this little guy showed up:

<Img src="big_ass_grasshopper_20070721_183012_01" alt="2.5 inch long grasshopper sitting on top of an outside showerhead" />

Took this photo with my most recent [point and shoot](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/fujifilmf31fd/).

I'm pretty happy with the quality.
