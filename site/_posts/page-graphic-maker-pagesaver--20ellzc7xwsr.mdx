Just found a "pagesaver" tool that's a Firefox extension that takes
a page and makes a graphic out of it. Very helpful for those times
when you need to screen grab an entire web page and it breaks the
fold of your monitor.

Can even be run from the command line. So, if you don't mind
dedicating a machine to it you can scirpt to pull a grab of a page
at a regular interval.
