With a title like
"[Strap-on robot suit takes the pain out of backbreaking farm work](http://mdn.mainichi.jp/national/news/20080110p2a00m0na022000c.html)"
you know you want one even if you're not a farmer. I mean STRAP-ON
ROBOT SUIT! Even if you're not a complete geek, that's gotta sound
at least a little awesome. Countdown to a real life version of
Ripley's Loader has begun.
