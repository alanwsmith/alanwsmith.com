- This is for making code samples for Tik Tok
- The basic idea is to setup something where you type and the text stays centered in an area
- Or, maybe not centered, but 2/3 of the way over
- Could start on the left as normal but then pad itself and stay at the specific spot so that when you typed more the text pushes left instead of the cursor moving right
- Could be tied to a terminal or file in the background so you can run code
