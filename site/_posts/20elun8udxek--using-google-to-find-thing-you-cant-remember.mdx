Justin sent me a link today about the announcement of the new [Lego Mindstorms NXT][lego].

That's right, soon you too will be able to build your own wirelessly controlled lego robot. 

I was trying to remember the name of an 80s movie where little robots went around killing people and causing general havoc. Couldn't remember the name of it, but I remembered there were spider like robots and some type of heat seeking bullets in it. Turning to google, I just typed in "robot spider movie heat seaking bullet". The first link [from the results](http://www.google.com/search?hs=Kvv&hl=en&lr=&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&q=robot+spider+movie+heat+seaking+bullet&btnG=Search), had the name I was looking for: [Runaway][runaway]

The Internet is cool.
