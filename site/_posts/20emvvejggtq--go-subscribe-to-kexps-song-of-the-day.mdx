If you want to discover some new music, check out [KEXP's Song of the Day](https://kexp.org/podcasts/song-of-the-day/).

I dig the general style of music they push. Combined with the fact that each "episode" is really an mp3 of a single song, it makes it one of the best podcasts I've found. As a bonus, they have all their old stuff up. 

If you subscribe in iTunes and then hit get all, you'll receive hundreds of individual songs. 

Awesome.
