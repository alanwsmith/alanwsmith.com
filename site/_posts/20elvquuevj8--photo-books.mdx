Another find from Kevin Kelly's Cool Tools is
[Blurb](http://www.blurb.com/) for printing photo books. I haven't
used the service yet, but it sounds like Mr. Kelly has tried most
of the players in the game and like Blurb the best. You can check
out the full review
[here](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001520.php). It's so
very cool that the technology of book printing has moved to the
point where basically anyone can afford to have a one off copy or
low runs of their personal book publised. I really need to find
time to put one of these together.
