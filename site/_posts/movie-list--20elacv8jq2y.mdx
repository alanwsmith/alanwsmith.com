Just posted a copy of the AFI top 100 list so I can [check off the movies I've seen](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/top-100-movie-checklist/).

Right now, I'm about half way through. 

There are some movies (like [Rear Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear_Window)) that I'm pretty sure I've seen, but it's tied up with some other films in my brain so I'm not counting it yet.
