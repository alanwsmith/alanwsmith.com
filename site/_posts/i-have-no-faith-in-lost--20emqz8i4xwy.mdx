I just read a post titled
"[How Lost bends the rules](http://www.boingboing.net/2009/01/22/how-lost-bends-the-r.html)"
on [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/). I'm one of the people
the article talks about that dropped out of the show some time ago
and hasn't watched it since. I think it was in the middle of the
second season I got tiered of the constant "twist". I remember a
promo that ran before one of the episodes that was along the lines
of "Three answers to big questions in tonight's episode". Of
course, there weren't any real answers and they actually piled on
more questions. I love the idea of a show where you aren't spoon
fed everything in the first five minutes and I'm a huge fan of
complexity in stories.
[Battlestar Galactica](http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/) being a
prime
[example](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/2006/02/battlestar/). When
I first start watching "Lost" I thought it might be like that, but
in the second season those thoughts quickly soured. The producers
of Battlestar have said that they really wanted the overall
narrative to have a beginning, middle and end. They didn't want to
create something that, if it became highly successful, just went on
and on simply because it was attracting viewers. My impression of
Lost became that their producers were doing just the opposite. I
had visions of them sitting around a table every few weeks pitching
ideas for what kinda crazy, off-the-wall shit they could come up
with next. I hope I'm wrong and that when the series wraps up, it
turns out that it really was a hugely complex and intricately
assembled narrative. Based on how it felt like I was getting jerked
around to the point where I stopped watching, I'm not optimistic
about that.
