Was just trying to remember how big the original 7-Eleven Big Gulp was and got to the [7-Eleven Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-Eleven) and noticed that they now have a Team Gulp. 

No less than 128 fluid ounces. 

For those of you who aren't up on your conversion tables, that's 1 gallon. 

Good Lord, no wonder we are a fat nation.
