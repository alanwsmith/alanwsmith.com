### [Start - 00:00:00] - More Work On Django

This stream was all about making forms. Toward the end, [ekkejD](https://www.twitch.tv/ekkejD) joined the chat and gave me some great pointers about using generic views. I'm going to go back through everything with them in mind. I have a feeling theirs a solid way to go. 


### Table Of Contents

- [Part 1](/stream-notes-2020-10-06/) - Getting the home page to work
- [Part 2](/stream-notes-2020-10-08/) - Reviewing the first draft and building a model, view, and url structure for a checklist page
- [Part 3](/stream-notes-2020-10-09/) - Learning how to test. And, making a python module so that unittest's output is green instead of red when tests pass. 
- [Part 4](/stream-notes-2020-10-10/) - More progress with testing and getting database content to show up. (Also, updating my local Hugo site to launch into either Sublime Text 2, or Sublime Text 3.)
- [Part 5](/stream-notes-2020-10-10-2/) - Working with forms and getting a pointer to generic views.
- [Part 6](/stream-notes-2020-10-11/) - Review run-through and adding URLs.
