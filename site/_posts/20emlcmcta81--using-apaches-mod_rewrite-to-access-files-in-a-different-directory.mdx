I like clean URLs. Nothing more than:

	http://example.com/page-name


This is part of how I set that up when I was using apache via mod_rewrite


```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/pages/$1.html  -f
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/pages/$1.html [L]
```


TODO: Add more details on exactly what this is doing.
