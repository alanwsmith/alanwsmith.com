Moving some stuff around my garage a couple months ago I almost put my hand right into a spider's web. No big deal, really, save for the type of spider. Here's a photo of the little bugger after a good carpet bombing with Raid:

For those not familiar with the red hourglass shape, it's the mark of a black widow. 

Good times.
