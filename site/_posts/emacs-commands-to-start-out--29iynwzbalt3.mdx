title: Emacs Commands To Start Out
slug: emacs-commands-to-start-out--29iynwzbalt3
---

These are the emacs commands I learned in roughly the order I needed them. I'm using spacemacs with the vim bindings. 

(One big thing is that all these key combinations are shortcuts to functions that can be accessed via: `M-x function-name`

Note: The tutorial you start up with `C-h t` doesn't work well with spacemacs since there's a lot of changes that get made with it.




### Save and Exist (vim style)

```
ECS : w q
```

### Save and Exit (emacs style)

```
C-x C-s
C-x C-c
```

### Close Other Windows

`M-x delete-other-widows`


### Execute A Code Block (inside the block)

```
C-c C-c
```

### Cycle Themes

```
SPC T n
```
