For those of you that use Adobe PhotoShop. If you want to add a text copyright stamp to your image while using the text tool you can do it by holding down the "Alt" key and then pressing the following number in order on your number pad: 0, 1, 6, 9.  

While you are typing in the numbers you won't see anything change.

Once you punched in all four and release the "Alt" key, the copyright symbol will appear.
