This is a great peice of code that del.icio.us provides. The have it setup to that you can use it as a bookmark in Firefox and it sets up to create your link for you.

```
javascript:location.href='http://del.icio.us/anotherequinox?v=3&url='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent(document.title)
```

On the page, after you fill in your info, it kicks you back to the originating page. Very well done.

If you haven't played around with del.icio.us yet, you should.
