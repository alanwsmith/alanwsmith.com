I use Windows Explorer a lot to move around and look at files. A shortcut for this on a windows xp box is to navigate to whereever your "Windows Explore" shortcut icon is under your start menu and add a Shortcut key to it. You do this by right clicking on the icon and selecting properties. Then, click inside the "Shortcut key" field and select the hot-key combination (like, say "Ctrl + Alt + E") you want to use.

You can do this for any Shortcut as long as it's either on your desktop or in your start menu. Unfortunately, assigning a shortcut key for items in your Quick Launch bar don't work.
