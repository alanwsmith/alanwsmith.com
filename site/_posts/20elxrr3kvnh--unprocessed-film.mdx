Dave mentioned that he [just processed](https://davidcampbellsblog.blogspot.com/2006/01/processed-bunch-of-old-film.html) a lot of undeveloped film. 

Here is a little of what I still have in the same un-processing state.

<Img src="unprocessed_file_20060125_010408a" alt="Two dozen unprocessed rolls of file. Both 35mm and 120mm" />

For those of you who give me grief about not posting images quickly, just think about the fact that I haven't shot film in a few years...
