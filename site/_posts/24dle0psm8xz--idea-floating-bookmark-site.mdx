- Not sure if that's the right term for it, but basically looking to make book marks that instead of making a page, they mark your progress across multiple pages. 
- Browser extension is the first thought where you start the extension and give your progress marker (name?) a name. 
- The progress marker keeps track of the page you're on (and where in the page) so you can close it and come back to it. 
- When you go to a new web page, the progress marker shifts to point to that one
- Start off with local storage, but move to remote storage so you can track across devices
- Next stage that would be great is if you didn't have to click the links to go from page to page, but if there was a collection of pages defined and there were links to take you from one to the next. 
- That would let you do things like move through documentation without having to figure out where to click to get to the next page (which often seems to require going back to an index)
- Ideal setup would be to let folks submit collections. Maybe a GitHub repo with a text file for each collection that's just the list of URLs. 
- Could let the extension load in sets too by pulling from a URL or uploading from a local file
- Actually, you're probably want the feeds to be JSONs. Was thinking it would be nice if it could just be one line, but getting meta data like explicit titles would be a nice feature. Could also do some sub-directory or chapter style stuff as well. So, need to come up with a format for that. (And version the format)
