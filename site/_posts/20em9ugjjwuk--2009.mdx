Was looking at the Toyota [web site](http://www.toyota.com/) and
noticed on their front page that they are promoting their
[2009 Corolla](http://www.toyota.com/vehicles/future/corolla/index.html?s_van=GM_HOME_MATRIX_FUTURE_TXT).
Now, I understand if you launch a car in October or November that
car companies would want to use the following year for the model's
name since most of the time it would be sold in that year. But come
on.... We haven't even passed the calendar start of 2008 yet and
they are promoting their 2009 models? I call Marketing Bull Shit.
