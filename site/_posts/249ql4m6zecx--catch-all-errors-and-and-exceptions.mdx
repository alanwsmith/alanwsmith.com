NOTE: Generally speaking this [isn't a great idea](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10594142/102401), but you can catch all errors with:


```python
try:
    with open('file-that-does-not-exit') as _file:
        print('will not make it here')
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
finally:
    print('and we are out')
```

The general reason to avoid it is that you can't tell what errors are happening and that might lead to unexpected things depending on what you put in the `except`
