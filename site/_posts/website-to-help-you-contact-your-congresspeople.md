[CommitteeCaller.com](http://committeecaller.com/) uses open source
software to let you call every member of a congressional committee
in sequence. In this day of email communication, I'd wager getting
a phone call from an individual has a little more weight. Some
additional pondering: - On average, how many individual phone calls
from constituents does it take to equal one meeting/call with a
corporate lobbyist? - What carries more weight when received from a
constituent: a phone call, a typed physical letter or a hand
written letter?
