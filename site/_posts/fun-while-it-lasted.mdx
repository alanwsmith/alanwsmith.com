I was expecting to spend a little time on the Four Links and Daily Video projects. Ended up taking way longer than I expected. Even when I was batching them and trying to do several posts at a time to have in the can. If that was personal stuff, I wouldn't mind, but it's too much time away form stuff I'm making. So, an interesting experiment comes to an end quickly. I may still do them from time to time, but for now, I'm putting those on hold.
