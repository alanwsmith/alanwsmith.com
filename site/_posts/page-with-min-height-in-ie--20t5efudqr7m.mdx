Thanks to this article:

I've been trying to figure out a way to apply a minimum height to a page in IE as well as firefox using style sheets.

The expression hack is great. I haven't run it thru a full QA setup but for the two local browsers on my machine (which probably represent over 90% of browsers out there), the following works:

```css
#theElement {
    min-height: 510px;
    height:expression("465px");
}
```

It appears that they operate a little differently for the spacing in the way I have them setup. This may or may not be the case all the time.
