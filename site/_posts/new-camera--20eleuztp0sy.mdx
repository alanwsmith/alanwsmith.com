This starts with a sad note. A best friend of someone I worked with
committed suicide a few weeks back. I never met him, but he was a
photographer. My colleague is helping the family go thru the stuff
and found this camera which he has given to me.

It's one of the ones from pinholephotography.com. I've always
thought it would be cool to own one of these. Obviously, not the
way I would have wanted to come by one, but I'm honored to have
this one. It's going to be a while before I get a chance to shoot
with it, but I certainly will. The camera shoots on 4x5 film and
the pinhole was formed by marching metal so it should be about as
sharp a pinhole as you can get. As long as it's been since I've
messed with film, it's probably been double that since I've done
anything 4x5. Should be a treat. I'll probably have to have someone
else process it since I don't think I have access to 4x5 tanks
anymore.
