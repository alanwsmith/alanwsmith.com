Just took my little car into the shop to get the timing belt changed and a good tune-up done. My last timing belt broke around 80,000 miles. Since I'm at 165,000, I figure it's about time again. The little Camry is purring like a kitten now. 

I'm so impressed with the engineering of the car, and I love that it was designed for longevity instead of obsolescence. Hopefully, I'm not jinxing myself here, but the only thing I've really done to it is change the oil and replace the timing belt the first time it broke. 

Oh yeah, I've also been thru a lot of tires. 

Now, all I need to do is figure out if I want to upgrade the stereo and speakers again...
