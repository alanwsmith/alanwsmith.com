Well, not really Western for some people, but I figure since this was taken in Key West, it counts. 

Went down there over the weekend for a friends birthday. On the way back I heard rumors of snow in other places. That makes the fact that it was a little cool in the Keys okay, I suppose.

The trip, not surprisingly, was a bender. I'm actually sore from drinking. Hell, I even danced while there which is very out of character.
