While driving home this morning from a night out, I came across a 1
car accident that must have happened about 45 seconds before I
caught up to it. It was a lady who was driving a Dodge Dakota that
had a blow out in the rear passenger side tire. She was trying to
pull off to the right side of the road, but somehow the car ended
up upside down, pointed backwards on the left side. She was a
little banged up, but other than freaking out a lot seemed
relatively uninjured considering that the drive side of the
passenger compartment was almost completely collapsed. The lady
said that she had been telling her husband for a while that the
tires were bad. I don't know exactly what she meant, but the entire
wheel was gone. This is the second one car wreck I've happened upon
that was the result of a tire blowing out on the highway. Let me
say that making sure your tires are in good working order is a
really good idea.
