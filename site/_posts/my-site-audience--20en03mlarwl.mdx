TODO: Make a VENN Diagram showing a few of your possible audiences. 


Know Your Audience. A constant theme in the publishing industry. 

Trying to think about the audience for my site as a whole doesn't work. My pieces are far too spread out in the thought space for that. 

Photographers
Programmers
Alabama Fans
Myself in the future
Programmers who are new to ruby
People who want to build a home file server
People who want to build their own DVR.
People who like power tools.
Developer
Designers



If I only wrote for the most limited of those, this site wouldn't be a web site. It would be the contents of my Grimoire 


Instead of trying to think about that from the site perspecrtive, I focus each peice for an audience. This make the site a multi-segmented audice. 

I suppose I should stop calling this a blog and just call it my site.
