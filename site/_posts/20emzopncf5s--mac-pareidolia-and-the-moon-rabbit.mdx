Cracking open a Mac to upgrade the hard drive reveals a little pareidolia robot on the motherboard waving to say, "Hi."

Paraphrasing the [global tome of knowledge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia), Pareidolia is the psychological phenomenon of a random image being perceived as significant. Common examples include seeing animals or faces in clouds, the Man in the Moon or the Moon Rabbit. 

In related news: Today, I learned about the [Moon Rabbit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_rabbit) who makes The Elixir of Immortality.
