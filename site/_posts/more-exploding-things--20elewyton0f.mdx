I don't think I've posted this one yet, but it follows along the same lines of [not putting your beer in the freezer](/20eLZttwTIRX).

That makes things explode because they are too cold. 

Hot cars in Florida can have the opposite temperature extreme with the same effect.

Don't leave unopened cans in the car.

I grabbed a Barq's at the store one day and didn't realize it was diet till I was well on my way. I figured I'd just toss it in the fridge at work and someone would drink it. Only, I didn't take
it out of my car. 

There was surprisingly little liquid, in the can (or on the floor or the roof) after the explosion. 

I think a lot of it must have evaporated almost instantly when it exploded. Wish I had had video in the car. 

It's almost worth trying that, but I'm afraid it would cook the camera before the beverage.
