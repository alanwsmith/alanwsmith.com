ChinaTown - really good.  
The Two Jakes - Not so much. Pretend it doesn't exist. It's rare
that I stop a movie without watching the whole thing, but this one
was a strugle.  
Jack should have convinved Roman Polanski to direct.  
Also saw Cool Hand Luke a few days ago. You should see that if you
haven't already.
