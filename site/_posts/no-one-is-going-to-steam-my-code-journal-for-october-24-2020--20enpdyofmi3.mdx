[Third Saturday In October](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Saturday_in_October).

Roll Tide. 

I'm watching Django tutorials before the game. The ones from [CodingEntrepreneurs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWEHue8kksIaktO8KTTN_zg). 

I think they're pretty good. But, it's tough  to tell. I'm still in the early ones. I've spent so many hours making my own notes that I don't know if I'm pickup up stuff or if it's already in my head. Either way, the approach I'm working is better for the way I learn. 

I'm not sure if I'm going to go full bore with building my own tutorial. It's already been a lot of work and it's going to be a lot more. I just don't know if the value is worth the effort. There are a ton of other tutorials out there. Even though my approach is different, it's hard to imagine it not getting drown out.

Anyway, I'm making progress on it. 

For my music sync project, I realized I don't need to worry about streaming the coding sessions. As long as I don't post them to YouTube, the likelihood of someone stealing my code is minuscule. This is great. I've been itching to make progress, but I only code when I stream. Worrying about putting the code out there permanently was blocking me. Now it's not.

Time to scratch an itch.
