This is one of the best little write ups about
[how to use credit cards wisely that I've seen](http://www.radicalguides.com/2005/05/the_radical_gui.html).
It's long, but worth a read. It's another example of someone
posting something on the net just because he wants to put the info
out there and he's not trying to make a buck. Refreshing.
