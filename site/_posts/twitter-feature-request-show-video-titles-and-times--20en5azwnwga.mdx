TODO: Figure out why this isn't working in MDX


Dear Twitter, 

I have a feature request for video links. The current "View media" feature is nice.

The in-line, expanded card it opens is great.

But, I'd like be to see the video's name and it's length without having to click/tap anything. Please consider replacing the URL with the title and run time in the initial display. For example, instead of:

TODO: Restore image here: {{/* img src="twitter-current-video-link.png" */}} 

Maybe something like:

TODO: Restore image here: {{/* img src="twitter-vidoe-link-with-details.png" */}} 

Thanks, 

-a
