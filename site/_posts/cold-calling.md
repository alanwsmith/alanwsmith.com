I get cold calls from time to time about tech stuff. Usually
staffing agencies. Just got one today on voice mail and the caller
had such a thick Indian accent that it took me 30 seconds to figure
out what he was calling about. A good principal in cold calling
would be to make sure the person doing the call has a voice like a
radio announcer. Communication is all you have going for you at the
start of a cold call, so the voice (and accent) are about the most
important thing in the first few seconds.
