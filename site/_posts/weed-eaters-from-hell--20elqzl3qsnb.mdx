At work today they are doing yard work. For the past three hours there has been a constant barrage of weed eaters, leaf blowers and edgers all running at the same time. I'm about to stab my ears with a pencil to get away from the noise. 

I'd heard before that one of the ways to interrogate/torture people is to subjugate them to constant loud noise. There isn't more than a few hundred square feet of grass outside the office. So, I'm beginning to think I'm the subject of some soft of psychology experiment.
