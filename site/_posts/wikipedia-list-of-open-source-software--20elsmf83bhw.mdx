I think the Wikipedia is one of the best things on the internet. 

I think Free and Open Source Software is one of the best things of our time. 

So, this is pretty damn good: The [Wikipedia list of Open Source Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_software_packages).

Awesome.
