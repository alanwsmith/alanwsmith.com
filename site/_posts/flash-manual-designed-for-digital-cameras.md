I found an amuzing item while reading through the manaul for my
Canon Flash. There is a footnote that says:
*If the flash exposure confirmation lamp does not light, move closer to the subject and take the picture again. You can also increase the camera's ISO speed.*
Seems that Canon feels that if you are using a recent flash you are
going to be using it on a digital camera. In the film days, in
order to increase your ISO you had to switch rolls of film.
