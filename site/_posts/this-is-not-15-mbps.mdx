Everyone in my community gets basic cable and internet through the home owners association. The internet provider offers upgrades to boost your speed from the base 1.5 Mbps to 10, 15 or 20, depending on how much you're willing to pay. I'm trying the 15 Mpbs level, but it does not work as advertised. Here's some typical results from [speedtest.net][1].

That 2.89 number in the middle is the one that's supposed to be ~15. After spending a fruitless hour on the phone with the support guy, a technician is now scheduled to come out later in the week. I would have dealt with this earlier, but I knew I'd have to burn time getting through the first level of support. Sadly, we don't yet live in a world where techies can utter the word "[Shibboleet][2]" and immediately get past the entry level support team. 

(*Other techies will enjoy the fact that I also did a little prep work by jacking directly into the cable modem with a Cat 6 cable. It still took four or five times to confirm to the support guy that I was, in fast, sure that I wasn't going through a router.*)
