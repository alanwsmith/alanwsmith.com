And after show that, so I think everyone is going to laugh when I started to run the after shows. OK, we're going to slow down now because that got a little fast paced. I like doing this. I do, I very much do.

00;00;21;19 - 00;00;46;11

I keep going back and forth on. This idea of where we are in our relationship. Dear listener, you and I. Like, I'm talking to you individually, right, this is me having a communication with you, but I don't know what portion of our relationship already exists to you and what doesn't.

00;00;48;16 - 00;01;10;16

Here's where I'm headed with this. There's different ways that somebody can interact with these episodes or interact with me through these episodes, or that we can have an interaction through this medium of the podcast. I guess. one way is you could pick this up basically as soon as I release it and listen along and then listen all

00;01;10;16 - 00;01;23;04

along and follow in real time. Some of the episodes that I'm going to do are going to be publishing ones that I did back over the past two years, maybe even. Actually, I think it's three years because maybe four years I can't remember.

00;01;23;04 - 00;01;37;16

It's been a while. Those things started just as recording videos, and I can actually go all the way back because there's another aspect here, which is when I really first started doing recording and first I had the idea of a podcast really popped into my brain and thought about this in a while is when I had my

00;01;37;16 - 00;01;55;06

first major manic episode and ran around my house naked recording for like four days until I went to the hospital. That's a story for another time. All that content exists. I'm going to publish that. I'm going to publish all the other podcasts I've done my cars over the years are car over the years.

00;01;56;05 - 00;02;08;14

Actually, cars, I've been through two cars with that thing, so I will publish those in a stream in that three mile include these plus those in different orders, potentially, but those those will be out of their own time.

00;02;09;05 - 00;02;23;18

But then you can actually go back and sort these things chronologically and make a feed that's a chronological feed. If you started that feed at the beginning and walked all the way through, you've now listen to me for 100 episodes and you're hearing me talking about starting again, but acknowledging I'm starting again.

00;02;24;25 - 00;02;36;16

You could just hear a single episode like you could just hear this because for whatever reason you found it, or you could hear some of the future ones and then come back to this, you pick up the catalog in five years.

00;02;36;24 - 00;02;50;01

You could listen to the last three episodes, then decide you want to go all the way back to the start. There's all these interactions and all these ways. So this is like giving you a perspective of a thing that I'm thinking about here, which is like, I don't know how to talk to you.

00;02;50;28 - 00;03;06;04

Because I don't know where in our relationship we are. And the first thing as soon as I said that that came to mind is if you have ever watched Doctor Who. And you're familiar with the storyline of River Song, there's similarities there.

00;03;06;07 - 00;03;22;15

That is really intriguing. I'm not going to I'm not going to say spoilers. I will just say that there are parallels there. If you've not watched Doctor Who, I think I have on my website a list of episodes of Doctor Who that you want to watch, you can either watch all of them or it's like a pass

00;03;22;16 - 00;03;33;01

down list of the ones that by general consensus people said these are like the main story ones and get you not having to watch all the ones that maybe either aren't great or aren't central to the main storyline.

00;03;34;11 - 00;03;49;09

There's going to be some back and forth. Figuring that out, but increasingly and you'll actually hear this as I go through with some of the other things from the years ago, from the before times, from the forecasts, I guess before cast are, that's not bad.

00;03;50;11 - 00;04;02;05

From the forecast, I would keep running into this issue of. This same type of stuff, like trying to figure out like where we are. You'll hear all about that. This is kind of the way that I think these might run.

00;04;02;26 - 00;04;16;26

We do a proper episode and then I kind of chill out and then back off a little bit. My expectation is I will tend to get ramped up in the original episodes, then I'll kind of cut back, but sometimes absolutely what will happen is will still be like rolling on the idea.

00;04;17;07 - 00;04;34;18

We'll get back into it again and whatever. Also, who knows how long you think your last summer will last? While some member laughs less long, I'm not worried about any of that. The other thing is to put straight out there is I am in no way looking for a sponsorship or any type of monetary or monetary monetary

00;04;34;21 - 00;04;51;22

thing associated with this. I my goal is to be able to do this for myself, for the thing that I want to do with no external thing. Lots of people run podcasts and they're trying to get sponsorship. Totally get that.

00;04;52;02 - 00;05;03;00

I'm in a position where I don't have to worry about that, and I'm also in a position where the way that I would have to go about trying to monetize and do that stuff would make me not want to do this.

00;05;03;20 - 00;05;14;08

It's this extra effort it's having to do. It is like having all the sponsorship in a store. I'm like, cut in ads or do you like all that other stuff? That would make me not do this thing. And I want to continue to do the thing.

00;05;14;25 - 00;05;25;10

It's just not going to happen. Same thing with my website. For the longest time, I never did ads. I never did that stuff for a very brief time. I put the links where if you click on them, you get money.

00;05;25;10 - 00;05;37;20

If somebody clicks on him and he goes to Amazon or whatever. Now am I saying that I would never do that again? No. If I do this for the next 50 years, all of a sudden there's a bunch of listeners, whatever they're clicking on stuff, and I could get some money off of that.

00;05;38;00 - 00;05;50;23

Yes, or maybe. But. As much as possible, I'm going to push back against that unless it's like, OK, there is everybody's got a no, I have no, I haven't really thought what that number is, but there is a number out there.

00;05;50;24 - 00;06;02;28

Absolutely. I am not at all worried about that, and I don't ever want to have to inch close to it either. I'm going to be at zero or I'm going to be at 100. And please understand I'm not trying to like knock on folks that do that.

00;06;04;04 - 00;06;16;01

That's just that's not where my head's up, so I think that'll run it for this one to. Yes, he's not right. The other thing that I still have to figure out a little bit about is getting out of these like what's the as good strategy?

00;06;16;28 - 00;06;27;06

Maybe I should say, and now I'm going to eject and then like Brazil or do whatever the sound is. We'll figure that out. Appreciate you all. Take it easy. Be kind we will see you next time. Cheers.
