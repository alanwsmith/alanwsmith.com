This is the example from:

https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/list?hl=fr&apix_params=%7B%22part%22%3A%5B%22snippet%22%5D%2C%22id%22%3A%5B%22Iy8R5TZNV1A%22%5D%7D&apix=true

NOTE: I'm not sure if it's completely since it doesn't show how to use the token. I've got another page on the site that shows how to do that. 

TODO: Update this to make sure it's a complete, stand alone sample

TODO: Link to other pages if necessary

TODO: Figure out more about what `OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT` is doing in here since I didn't need it for my other scripts.


```python3
#!/usr/bin/env python3 

import os

import google_auth_oauthlib.flow
import googleapiclient.discovery
import googleapiclient.errors

scopes = ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly"]

def main():
    # Disable OAuthlib's HTTPS verification when running locally.
    # *DO NOT* leave this option enabled in production.
    os.environ["OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT"] = "1"

    api_service_name = "youtube"
    api_version = "v3"
    client_secrets_file = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE.json"

    # Get credentials and create an API client
    flow = google_auth_oauthlib.flow.InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(
        client_secrets_file, scopes)
    credentials = flow.run_console()
    youtube = googleapiclient.discovery.build(
        api_service_name, api_version, credentials=credentials)

    request = youtube.videos().list(
        part="snippet",
        id="Iy8R5TZNV1A"
    )
    response = request.execute()

    print(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
