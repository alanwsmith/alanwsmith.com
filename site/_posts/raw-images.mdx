Took the new camera out last night to do some shooting of a
friend's band for him. Well into the night, after not a few 7&7s I
also shot a photo of the bartenders. (Always a good thing to get to
know your bartenders well, and giving them prints every once in a
while pays off very nicely.) I noticed there was a mirror behind
them so turned to where I though I would be okay. I was a little
off, and it didn't help that there were actually two mirrored
surfaces. You can see my strobe both times in and how it effected
the exposure in this image:

If I was shooting JPEG, this would have broken apart badly if I
lightened it to a decent level. Since I shot it in RAW I figured
I'd see how far I could push it to save the image as much as
possible. I'm pretty pleased with the result.

This is the first time I've really pushed an image like this and I
must say I'm pretty impressed. More importantly, I've salvaged an
image that I can drop off for the bar crew.
