Huzzah! Bama Football starts tonight!

To finish the elephant countdown, I'm changing things up a little. The elephants in the rest of the countdown were gifts my mom has given me since I moved to Florida (A.K.A. Enemy Territory). Today's elephant was given to me by my dad when I was about five. We were living in Virginia. He had taken a business trip to Africa and brought this little fella back to give me as a souvenir. The piece is made of ebony with ivory tusks. I've treasured this guy since long before we moved to Alabama or I attended The Capstone. It's neat that something I loved so much as a kid has such a connection to the rest of my life. 

Here's hoping everyone has a great season and the player for each team stay healthy and safe.

Roll Tide, Roll!
