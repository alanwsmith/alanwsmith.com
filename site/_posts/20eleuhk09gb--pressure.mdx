Haven't noticed this before, but I pulled up beside a cement truck the other day and saw this on their tires:

I'm guessing the driver can actually control the pressure in the tires to depending on how much cement is in the mixer.

I wonder how much weight those tires can support. The concept of a ton is hard for me to grasp.
