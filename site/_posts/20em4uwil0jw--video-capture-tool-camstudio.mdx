A video capture tool I need to checkout is
[CamStudio](http://www.camstudio.org/). It's open source and let's
you make flash files. According to the main page there is a bug in
the generation where the "EMBED SRC" tag doesn't have the proper
width and height which causes issues with firefox. The fix,
apparently, is to just copy the width and height from the "OBJECT
CLASSID" tag.
