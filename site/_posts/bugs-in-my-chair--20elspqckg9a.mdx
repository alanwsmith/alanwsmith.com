Okay, this is a photo of the bottom of my office chair at work.

<Img src="wire_on_the_bottom_of_my_chair_20060921_131744_01.jpg" alt="The bottom of a chair that has been turned over on its side with a loop of wire coming out of the plastic seat mount" />

What the Hell is that wire doing there? 

Seems like that loop would make a nice antenna...
