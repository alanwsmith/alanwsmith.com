Had this problem:

```
$ docker build -t my-container-name .

Based on this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/66993669/102401

I figured I'd troubleshoot with this:


```
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0  docker build .
```

That command was successful and then I could run my original command and it worked. not sure what happened there, but that cleared whatever it was.
