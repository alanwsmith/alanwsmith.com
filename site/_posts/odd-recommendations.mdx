Just logged into Netflix. One of the features it provides is
recommendations based on what you like. The two it just gave me are
"The Muppet Movie" and "Stalag 17". Me thinks you could read into
that that my taste in movies is relatively varied.

P.S. spell check didn't know the word "Muppet" or "Stalag".
