title: External Images Arent Responsive In Gatsby With Gatsby Remark Images
type: post
slug: external-images-arent-responsive-in-gatsby-with-gatsby-remark-images--20enyqnqasms

Using `gatsby-remark-images` images called from another site weren't responsive for me with:  


```javascript
resolve: `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
options: {
    extensions: ['.mdx', '.md'],
    // a workaround to solve mdx-remark plugin compat issue
    // https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/15486
    plugins: [
        `gatsby-remark-images`,
    ],
    gatsbyRemarkPlugins: [

        {
            resolve: `gatsby-remark-images`,
            options: {
                linkImagesToOriginal: false,
                maxWidth: 800,
                quality: 82,
                loading: "eager",
                disableBgImage: true,
            },
        },
        
        ... etc...
```

TODO: figure out a solution for this
