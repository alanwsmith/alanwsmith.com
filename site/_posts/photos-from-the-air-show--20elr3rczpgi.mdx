I just posted the
[images from last weekends air show](http://www.alanwsmith.com/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&g2_itemId=1145)
which was very fun to shoot. Next year I'll bring a monopod though
to make tracking with the 300 a little easier. Nuge is
[trying to switch his shooting eye](http://nugeworthy.blogspot.com/2005/10/right-eye.html#comments)
which brought up some conversation about keeping both eyes open
when shooting. Generally I don't, but for the parts of an air show
where jets are closing on each other at \~900 MPH you kinda have
to. Even if my camera had a fast motor drive you only get one shot
at these. By the time a second shot would go off the planes would
be well outside each end of the frame.
