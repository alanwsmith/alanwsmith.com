title: Setup And Deploy A SvelteKit App On Netlify
slug: setup-and-deploy-a-sveltekit-app-on-netlify--26u5xmsieeim
---


This is for making a sveltekit app that's one directory off the root. I like doing that so I can put docs and assets in the repo without out them being in the svelte dir. After cloning down a repo and moving into it I do this:


First, I make this netlify.toml file in the root


```toml
[build]
  base = "/site/"
  publish = "build"
  command = "npm run build"
```


Then I make a `site` sub-directory and initialize svelte in it:


```bash
mkdir site
cd site
npm init svelte@next .
```

(If you've never run the command before, you'll probably be asked if you want to install `create-...???` something which you'll need to do to continue.)



That brings up the install wizard: 

Choose: "Skeleton project"
Set TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Playwright as you see fit


Then, I run:

```bash
npm install -D @sveltejs/adapter-netlify@next
```

Config directions [are here](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/common-configurations/sveltekit/). It's a little unclear, but it looks like the `import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-auto';` that comes in the file is replaced by: `import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-netlify';`. The file format that comes from svelte is a little different than the netlify docs. Doesn't look like that matters, but I'm using this for the full contents of the file:

```javascript
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-netlify';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter()
	}
};

export default config;
```


NOTE:

- The Netlify docs say to add a `target: '#svelte'` in, but when trying to run the app, it says: `config.kit.target is no longer required, and should be removed` so I removed it.
