There is a locan NPR radio show that I listen to most nights called
"Electro Lounge" that comes on at Tuesday- Friday 9p-11p and
Saturday- 10p - 12p EST. Nice chill music. You can
[check out a stream of the show](http://www.wjct.org/streams_index.htm)
if you have a fast enought connection. Not always the best, but
usually has some really good stuff on it.

They call it "Down Tempo" which is a great term
