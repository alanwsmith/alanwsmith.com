I work on Mac, Linux and Windows machines during the course of an
average day. A lot of this work is done on the
[command line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line_interface).
Since underneath a Mac is the heart of a Linux type machine, the
basic commands that work on one also work on the other. Windows
machines are a different story. Lots of commands that work on
Mac/Linux are different on Windows machines or simply don't exist
at all.

For example, when you want to see what's in a directory from the
command line the Mac/Linux command is "ls", but on Windows, it's
"dir". Since most of my time is spent with Mac/Linux I end up
trying to use "ls" frequently when I'm working on a Windows
machine. This doesn't hurt anything, but it doesn't work and it is
a little break in the concentration.

The good news is that since most of the command line tools on a
Linux machine are open source, they can be
[ported](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ported) to different
operating systems. This is exactly what was done with the Open
Source project [UnxUtils](http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/). It's a
collection of most of the key command line tools Linux folks are
used to working with. If you spend most of your time on Mac/Linux
but have to bounce around the Windows command line on occasion, I
highly recommend them.
