title: Setting Up Org Mode Source Code Block Snippets In Spacemacs (Emacs)
slug: setting-up-org-mode-source-code-block-snippets-in-spacemacs-emacs--29mka1vyfeba

Took a bit to figure this one out. The goal it to setup snippets that auto expand into Org mode source code blocks. By default, you can type "SPC m i b s" when you're not in edit mode to generate a generic source code block like this:

```txt
#+begin_src
#+end_src
```

That's a lot of keys and you still have to define the language and any other options. I made the following additions to the `defun dotspacemacs/user-config` section at the bottom of my `~/.spacemacs` config file to make it nicer.

```lisp
(defun dotspacemacs/user-config ()
  (require 'org-tempo)
  (add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist
               '("j" . "src js :results output"))
  (add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist
               '("p" . "src python :results output"))
)
```

The `(require 'org-tempo)` line turns on some default snippet expansions like `<s` followed by TAB at the start of a line (in INSERT mode) for the basic begin/end src block. 

The `add-to-list` items let me type `<j` followed by TAB and `<p` followed by a TAB to generate:


```txt
#+begin_src js :results output

#+end_src
```

and

```txt
#+begin_src python :results output

#+end_src
```
