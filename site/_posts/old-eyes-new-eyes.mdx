I'm not sure where the line for legally blind is, but I know I couldn't do much without some type of corrective lens. Then, I had the lasik last month. It's amazing. For those photographers out there contacts were like looking at prints and after lasik it's like looking at chromes.  

Welcome to the world were science fiction has come to pass. I mean, I had my eye lasered and now I can see. Wild.
