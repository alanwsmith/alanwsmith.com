Doing a little Java development on the Mac. Just making a note to
myself about [XOM](http://www.xom.nu/) (an XML Object Model).
According to the web site, "XOMâ„¢ is a new XML object model. It is
an open source (LGPL), tree-based API for processing XML with Java
that strives for correctness, simplicity, and performance, in that
order.", and "XOM is designed to be easy to learn and easy to use.
It works very straight-forwardly, and has a very shallow learning
curve. Assuming you're already familiar with XML, you should be
able to get up and running with XOM very quickly."

Sounds worthy of looking into.

From a higher perspective, in order to utilize XOM the
xom-1.2.1.jar file (which can be downloaded from the XOM page),
must be added to the Java class path. On Macs, one possible
location for this is '/Library/Java/Extensions/'.
