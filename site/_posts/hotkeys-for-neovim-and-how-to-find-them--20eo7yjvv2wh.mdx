NOTE: Need to come up with a better title for this one. 


You can use `<M- >` to map things in neovim. For example:


`<M-LEFT>` is for Option+Left Arrow

Not everything will work with `M/option`, to check it, go to insert mode and press `CTRL-v` and then press the key combination you want to check. If it shows you, you can use it. The reason you may not be able to use it is if the terminal application you're using captures it to do something with it. 

As far as I can tell, you can't use Mac's command key to do stuff in iTerm2
