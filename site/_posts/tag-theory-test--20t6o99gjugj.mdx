From what I can tell blogger doesn't offer tagging of posts. This is something that I would like to have. My idea for a hack/workaround is to create my own keywords that shouldn't ever be real words. Then the search function provided at the top of the site (thru google) should allow effectively provide a list of all pages that have the pseudotag.

Of course, if you don't want the tags to show up, you could set them to the same font color as the background. Commenting them out might work too. Unknow at this time is whether or not the tags in comments would be picked up as well. I'm guessing probably. There will also likely be some delay before the virtual tags are picked up by the search engine.

So, here goes:
