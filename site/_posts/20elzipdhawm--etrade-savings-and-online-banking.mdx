title: E-Trade Savings and Online banking
slug: /posts/20elzipdhawm--etrade-savings-and-online-banking

E-Trade has recently started offering a great saving account that
they call "Complete Savings". It's your basic bank savings account
except for the fact that they are offering roughly 5% Interest.
They have a list of their rates
[here](https://us.etrade.com/e/t/home/completesavings?_skinnertab=bank).
All the savings accounts I've had before at traditional banks have
had less than 1% interest. For example, I have a Wachovia savings
account and their interest rate for balance (like mine) less than
$10,000 is 0.2% The E-Trade Complete Savings has no minimum and you
can start the account with as little as one dollar. Taking the
compounding out of it for now, let's say you put $1,000 in the
E-Trade account and $1,000 in a Wachovia type account. After one
year The E-Trade account would have made $50 compared to $2 from
the competition. To use E-Trade of course, you have to be
comfortable with Online Banking. Personally, I don't have a problem
with it. In fact, I've been using E-Trade since about 2000 (if
memory serves). In fact, I use them as my primary bank these days.
In regards to the Wachovia account I mentioned earlier, I still
keep that one open cause every now and then, I want to be able to
walk into a branch. Also, I use Wachovia for my ATM since they are
right across the street from me. This way I avoid racking up ATM
fees.
