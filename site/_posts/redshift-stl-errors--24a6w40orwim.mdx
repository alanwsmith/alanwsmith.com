If something borks when trying to insert data into redshift it throws errors to an `stl_load_errors` table. You can see them with:

```sql
select *
from stl_load_errors
order by starttime desc;
```    

I'm putting the word `stl_errors` here too because sometimes that's what I search for when I don't remember it properly.
