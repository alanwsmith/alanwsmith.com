That's right, [these folks](https://www.bostonretinalimplant.org/) are working to make a replacement eye.

Right now the goal is to treat blindness. Once they get it working, one has to wonder how long it'll be until the first elective one is installed/implanted. Also, how long till we stop making the distinction between the words "installed" and "implanted"?
