a little more research of CFLs trying to pick some to put in my
office for viewing prints. Seems that the important factors are
color temperature (which I knew) and the color rendering index
rating (which I was unfamiliar with. The higher the color rendering
index, or C.R.I. the closer to nature sunlight and the more
accurate colors will appear. Without getting into to many details,
most CFLs that are considered "Full Spectrum" that I saw had a
C.R.I. of 80-86. The
[BlueMax](http://www.fullspectrumsolutions.com/compact_fluorescent_32_ctg.htm)
line put out by the aptly named company
[Full Spectrum Solutions](http://www.fullspectrumsolutions.com/)
are described as having a C.R.I. of 96. So, they should be very
close to sunlight. They are more expensive than some of the other
lights out there, but I figure if their marketing is accurate and
they are going to last years like CFLs tend to do, it's worth it.
Going to get one to take a look at and then more if it seems like
it's as good as advertised.
