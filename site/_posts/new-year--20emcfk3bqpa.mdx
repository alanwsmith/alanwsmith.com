Haven't been posting much because work and holiday travel have
taken their toll on me. We finally got the redesign up. Ran into a
couple issues that pushed us back a few days, but it was live
before the new season started. Still have some cleaning up to do
along with finishing the build of a new project and redoing one old
one, but by Feb. things should return to a "normal" pace. I can't
wait.
