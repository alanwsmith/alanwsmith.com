Here's the error I ran into:

```

```

Setting this for the build command didn't work:

```bash
CI= npm run build
```

This was via: https://answers.netlify.com/t/new-ci-true-build-configuration-treating-warnings-as-errors-because-process-env-ci-true/14434

---

Also tried this, but it didn't work:

```
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader
```


---

This didn't work either:

```
npm i -D esbuild-loader
```

---

Trying making a webpack.config.js file with the below, but it didn't work:


```json 
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.tsx?$/,
        loader: 'esbuild-loader',
        options: {
          loader: 'ts', // Or 'ts' if you don't need tsx
          target: 'es2015',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

---


Adding this didn't work either:

```
npm i --save-dev @babel/core
```


---

Tried switching the default install of from 13.x to 12.x but that didn't work. 

```
"esbuild": "^0.13.15",
```

to:

```
"esbuild": "^0.12.29",
```

---


Trying this in the package.json but it didn't work. 


```
    "build": "if [ -f ./node_modules/esbuild/lib/main.d.ts ]; then rm ./node_modules/esbuild/lib/main.d.ts; fi && next build && cp _redirects .next/",
```

That got a new error:

```

```


---

Trying to removing:

```
"esbuild": "^0.13.15",
```

And switching:

```
"mdx-bundler": "^8.0.0",
```

to:

```
"mdx-bundler": "^6.0.3",
```


---

I still haven't figured this out. All that stuff was with v8 of mdx-bundler. I'm trying to go back to v6.

---

NOTE: Netlify pugin v4 does not work with NextJS v12 because of the SWC compiler

Tried this in `next.config.js` config but it didn't work:

```
swcMinify: false
```

based off: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/failed-loading-swc
