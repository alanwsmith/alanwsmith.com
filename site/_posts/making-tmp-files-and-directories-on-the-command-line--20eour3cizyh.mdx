Use `mktmp`

See the examples from `man mktmp`


           tempfoo=`basename $0`
           TMPFILE=`mktemp /tmp/${tempfoo}.XXXXXX` || exit 1
           echo "program output" >> $TMPFILE

     To allow the use of $TMPDIR:

           tempfoo=`basename $0`
           TMPFILE=`mktemp -t ${tempfoo}` || exit 1
           echo "program output" >> $TMPFILE

     In this case, we want the script to catch the error itself.

           tempfoo=`basename $0`
           TMPFILE=`mktemp -q /tmp/${tempfoo}.XXXXXX`
           if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
                   echo "$0: Can't create temp file, exiting..."
                   exit 1
           fi

On mac, it'll use a directory something like:

    /var/folders/dx/ypcmcxd53mb731bpkp_2p_vh0000gn/T/
    
That's what's set in $TMPDIR

It'll use `$_CS_DARWIN_USER_TEMP_DIR` if that's set instead. If neither of those are set, it'll fall back to `/tmp`
