Macs don't crash much. They also handle themselves well when a ton of apps are running. This was brought home when a co-worker saw me do a Cmd+Tab app switch. Here's a shrunken version of my active app icon bar that popped up.

That makes 62 apps (not counting all the behind the scenes stuff). Pretty good considering I haven't rebooted the machine in a month. The negative aspect is that with all this stuff open, I really put off any software updates that require restarting. Based on [this XKCD strip](http://xkcd.com/1328/), I'm not alone.
