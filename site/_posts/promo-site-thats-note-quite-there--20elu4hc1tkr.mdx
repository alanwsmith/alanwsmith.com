One of the current shows on NBC is "Studio 60" which is about a
fictional show on a fictional network (NBS). The web page for the
real world show is located at:
[http://www.nbc.com/Studio\_60\_on\_the\_Sunset\_Strip/](http://www.nbc.com/Studio_60_on_the_Sunset_Strip/)
One of the links on that page is to a website for the fictional
show:
[http://www.studio60theshow.com/](http://www.studio60theshow.com/).
The only problem is that they didn't quite finish building out this
promotion site. Seems that none of the links work. If you click on
"Cast" for example, you get a "404" page not found error. It would
have been an interesting marketing piece to look at, but it seems
to have run out of steam before completion. Oops.
