So, I finally got a new computer put together a little while ago.
Been so busy at work, I really haven't had time to do much with it
yet. Till tonight that is. I finally managed to dig into some old
photos. Mostly, I'm just getting them imported into lightroom.
2,577 music images so far. It's sooooooo much better with a
computer that can actually handle it. In the past, it was so slow,
that it really turned me off from doing much of anything
photo-wise. While I think there will always be room for
improvement, I wasn't really waiting on the computer for most
stuff. That's the major hurtle to get over. Even though I really
haven't done much messing around with the images yet, it really got
me thinking about how much I love photography. Now that I don't
have to dread the computer time, hopefully I'll be more likely to
shoot some. Of course, this will be after we get our redesign
launched. But still, it's nice to think about. Incidentally, here's
an image to celebrate the fact that I can actually work with images
now without wanting to stab myself in the leg with a fork to
distract myself from waiting on the machine. It's the drummer from
The CodeTalkers. Or, at least it was the drummer back in Sept. 2006
when this shot is from.

I've decided to decorate my office with some 11x14s of my music
images. I'm pretty sure this is going to be one of them.
