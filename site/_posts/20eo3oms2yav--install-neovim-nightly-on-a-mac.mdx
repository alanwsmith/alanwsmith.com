This is what's on the page to get the the latest version:

brew install --HEAD neovim

Not sure if it's actually nighlty, but it seems like it's at least close.

OLD NOTES:

NOTE: Not sure if this is the right way to do it. 

NOTE: This will probably have problems with LUA stuff since those dependencies don't seem to be met.


Download this:

    https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/download/nightly/nvim-macos.tar.gz
    
Doubleclick on the `.tar.gz` file in your ~/Downloads folder which will extract/untar the archive into a folder named `nvim-osx64`


Then you can copy:

    cp ~/Downlaods/nvim-osx64/bin/nvim /use/local/bin/nvim
    

Note that there are some other libraries the come down with the archive. No idea if you need to do something with them.
