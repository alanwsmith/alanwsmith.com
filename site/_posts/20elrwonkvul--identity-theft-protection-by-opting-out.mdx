title: Identity Theft Protection by opting out

Aside from snuffing out a huge portion of you junk mail another
benefit of opting out via
[optoutprescreen.com](http://www.optoutprescreen.com/) is that it
reduces the chance of identify theft from someone filling out your
info to apply for credit. I went to Home Depot this weekend and
applied for a credit card. The idea was to use their store credit
card to purchase some hardwood flooring since I would get 10% off
and no payments or interest till 2007. By which time I should have
easily sold my house which means I would have gotten a 0% loan for
an improvement. Anyways, after filling out the little pamphlet to
apply for the card the lady came back out and asked for my drivers
license. Generally they don't require any idea just a name that
matches a S.S.N. Because of the opt out, she had to call the credit
reporting agency and verify she was looking at my drivers license
and read the number over to them. The Home Depot lady said that's
the first time that had ever happened to her and that she never had
to ask for an I.D. for someone before. Very, very scary. So, if you
haven't opted out yet.
[Do it now](http://www.optoutprescreen.com/), and spread the word.
