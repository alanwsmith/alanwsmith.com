It has amazed me how much printer technology has improved. I bought a $100 photo printer a couple years ago that easily bested the $5,000 printer I used at the college design lab just a few years before.
  
C-Net has a great post up about how [the ink for these amazing machines is what you have to watch out for](http://news.com.com/Why+do-it-yourself+photo+printing+doesnt+add+up/2100-1040_3-5891575.html).

I rarely print things these days, but the easy of the online shops means that when I do, I almost always go with them.
