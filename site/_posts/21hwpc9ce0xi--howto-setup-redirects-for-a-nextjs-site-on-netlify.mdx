title: How-To Setup Redirects For A Next.js Site On Netlify
slug: /posts/21hwpc9ce0xi--howto-setup-redirects-for-a-nextjs-site-on-netlify

To use a _redirects file, set one up in the root of your project then change your `build` line in `package.json` to:


```
"build": "next build && cp _redirects .next/",
```

That puts the file in the right place at the end of the build process. 

via: https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/

which says: "Save a plain text file called _redirects without a file extension to the publish directory of your site." but doesn't tell you how to actually do it. 

TODO: put in syntax

Note: saw this in the build page of netlify:

```
A "_redirects" file is present in the repository but is missing in the publish directory ".next".
```

That was before I pushed it in with that package.json update.
