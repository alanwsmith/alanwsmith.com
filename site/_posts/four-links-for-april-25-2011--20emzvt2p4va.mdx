Today's collection of interesting/useful links:

1. [Photo Mechanic on sale for $60](http://www.camerabits.com/site/15th_Anniversary_Release.html) - Great price for a fantastic app (Regular price is $150.00). I use it for downloading, renaming and selecting images before moving to lightroom. Saves a ton of time. Sale goes to the end of April. (Thanks [Caryn](http://blog.icaryn.com/).)

2. [Click the Squares](http://seawitchery.tumblr.com/post/4070384205/i-started-out-clicking-strategically-and-by-the) - Make some music, visually. (Thanks to [T](http://www.tamikamoore.com/).)

3. [Postcards from Google Earth that Dali would enjoy](http://clementvalla.com/index.php?/work/bridges/) - Sometimes, when 3D meets 2D, things get weird. (If the direct link doesn't get you there, choose Selected Projects - Bridges from the side nav.)

4. [Visualising iPad interaction through fingerprints](http://news.designlanguage.com/post/1611663345) - Smudges on iPad glass after using various apps. This reminds me of another piece discussing how worn down numbers on door keypads make passcodes easier to guess.
