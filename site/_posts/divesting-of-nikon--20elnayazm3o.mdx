I'm on my way to Huntsville for a few days. I've decided I'm going to drop off most of my Nikon gear at Southerland's to sell.

On the block will be:

-   20mm f/2.8
-   24mm f/2.8
-   50mm f/1.8
-   105mm f/2.5
-   MD-4 Motordrive

I'm keeping my F3 HP body and a 35mm f/2.8 for the shelf. 

The F3 was my first camera and the 35 is my favorite perspective for a general carry 35mm film camera. I've focused a lot of light through the lenses I'm getting rid of, but since I'm hanging onto a working system, I don't feel (right now) like I'm giving anything up. 

That said, I'm hanging on to all my Hasselblad components at this point. I'm not ready to give any of them up yet.

Update November, 2021

I still have the F3 and all the Hasselblad gear :-)
