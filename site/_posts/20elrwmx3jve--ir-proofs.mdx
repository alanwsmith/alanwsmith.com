Here is the first real batch of Infra Red shots that I took a few
weeks ago. It's a raggae band named "De Lions of Jah" playing out a
bar called Spare Time. I had one strobe on the camera with an
infrared filter over it and was shooting with it on manual. I would
change either the flash output or the aperature depending on how
far away from the subject I was. Even after a fair amount of
drinking it was pretty easy to get a good guess on the
distance/power quickly. Of course, what really helped things was
the ability to get a quick review on the LCD screen.

Here's

One interesting thing about the IR shooting is that things tend to
change "color". Or, at least grayscale value. For instance,

was wearing a black shirt.
