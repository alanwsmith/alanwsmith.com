[David Bergman](http://www.davidbergman.net/) setup a
[GigaPan](http://www.gigapan.org/) system at the inauguration.
Check out the
[1,474 Megapixel photo](http://www.davidbergman.net/blog/2009/01/22/how-i-made-a-1474-megapixel-photo-during-president-obamas-inaugural-address/)
that was created. That's 1,474 not 1.474 like I thought when I
first read the description. Zoom on in, and then zoom some more.
Update:
[check out the snapshots](http://www.gigapan.org/viewGigapan.php?id=15374&snapshot_id=43491)
on the GigaPan site. Helps to key into the level of detail as it
zooms.
