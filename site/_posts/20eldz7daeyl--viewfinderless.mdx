This probably would never have occured to me and their may already
be some out there, but one of Canon's new point and shoots
[doesn't have a veiwfinder](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0602/06022109canonsd600.asp#press).
Just a big-ass LCD screen.

When I shoot with my point-and-shoot I rarely use the viewfinder,
but I also don't use the screen. Opting instead for a more zen
style where I point the camera in the general direction and pull
the trigger.

Generally, I'm not that big a fan of the LCD screens becuase of the
battery draw, but it's very nice to have the ability to see exactly
what the compisition looks like when you do use it.
