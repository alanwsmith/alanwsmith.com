TL;DR

If you've setup everything for the [Google Sheets API Python Sample](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python) and it launches your browser but hangs when you hit allow, try copying the URL from the console into Chrome (assuming that it was a different browser like Safari that launched in the first place).

Some folks reported having to do an incognito browser window or needing to use Firefox. Your milage may vary.

When I ran the app, it opened safari where I clicked through to allow access but then it hung and finally chocked with a message from the browser about not being able to find a localhost server. 

Turns out the solution was to copy the URL that shows up in the console and paste it into chrome. 

Took me a bit to find that answer via [this page](https://github.com/googleworkspace/python-samples/issues/88). Pasting this here in hopes it helps folks find the answer faster.
