I've heard a rumor that the first bulb Edison made is still
burning. Don't know if it's true or not but I've always thought it
would nice to have an ever lasting light bulb. Of course, light
bulb manufacturers probably don't like the idea. In theory, once a
certain number of bulbs were made there wouldn't be a need for any
more. This doesn't jive with planned obsolescence. Well it appears
that someone has come up with one that's close:

Apparently these also use way less electricity. I've tried a few of
the low energy usage florescent bulbs before but the tend to
flicker and a color cast that I really don't like. It's bad enough
that I still use regular incandescent bulbs. With luck, this will
meet all my needs. I'm ordering one to see how well it works.
