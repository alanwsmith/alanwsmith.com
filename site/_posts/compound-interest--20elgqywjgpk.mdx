I like looking at what compound interest can do for me (or anyone
else). So, I made a little page with some javascript on it to
create a simple compound interest display. As I've mentioned
recently, I just read The Richest Man in Babalyon again and one of
the main points is to keep 10% of what you earn for yourself. So,
plug in %10 of your pre-tax earnings and play around with the years
and the interest rate to see how the 10% position works well with
the simple but potent power of compounding interest.

NOTE: I've tested this on my Windows machine with FireFox and IE
and it works for both of them, but I haven't run this thru a full
QA so if it bugs out on you, let me know. Also, this is just an
estimate and I make no guarantees as to the accuracy of my math,
but it should be at least close.
