I use UltraEdit as my text editor. One might think that there's not much to a text editor. If you do a lot of code and are still using Notepad give UltraEdit a try. It's a great tool.

I have a few configuration options that I customize. I'll add them here as I think about it.

Key Mapping:
FileClose - Ctrl+W
EditWordWrap - Ctrl + Alt + W
