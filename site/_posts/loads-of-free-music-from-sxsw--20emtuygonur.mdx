I've mentioned before that [South by Southwest](https://www.sxsw.com/ "South by Southwest") releases music samplers with free MP3s on them from artists that play the festival. I just looked up this years and found [this page](http://hewgill.com/sxsw/ "SXSW Music Sampler torrents") that points to torrents of all the samplers. It's a huge amount of music.

Sadly, I still haven't actually made it to a SXSW festival yet.

I'll be trying again next year.
