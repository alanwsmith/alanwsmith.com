I took a much needed break from the day job a week and a half ago
and attended another [Supershoots](http://www.supershoots.com/)
event. Was gone for about 7 days and it was great. I really needed
to get away. I have come back very much refreshed and relaxed. Just
not very rested. There is a ton of shooting and mentoring that goes
on during the events, and when that's not happening there's a lot
of partying. Like all the other events I've done like this, I'm so
amped during the entire thing that I don't notice how little sleep
I'm getting. It's amazing how our bodies can respond to
opportunities like that. Of course, when you get back to the real
world, the payback is pretty high. On the first day I was back,
after a day in the office I was in bed by 8pm and slept for a solid
twelve hours. Next time I do one of these I should really schedule
an extra day of vacation to take at the house just to catch up on
sleep.
