I took the new camera out to photograph a friend's band last night. I find it's always a good idea to take some photos of the bartenders too. Helps to get to know them which tends to pay off nicely. 

I noticed a mirror behind them so I shifted to where I though the flash wouldn't reflect and cause issues with the exposure. Turns out that there were two mirrors and I was a little off. 

You can see the flash reflection and the under-exposure it caused in this image:

<Img src="raw_image_20060401_124150a_original.jpg" alt="An under-exposed and dark photo of five bartenders smiling in a group behind a bar." />

If I was using the JPEG image format to save the files, the image would have looked crummy if I tried to lighten it to a decent level. But, I was using RAW which allows much more manipulation while maintaining quality. 

I figured I'd see how far I could push it. I'm pleased with the result:

<Img src="raw_image_20060401_124150a_fixed.jpg" alt="Five bartenders smiling in a group behind a bar with an adjusted exposure lightening the photo to make it more visible" />

This is the first time I've pushed an image like this. I'm impressed. 

Bonus points for salvaging an image that I can drop off for the crew.
