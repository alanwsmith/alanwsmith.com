I updated my stream setup to bring the mic in for better audio. I'm experimenting with running it through Adobe Audition for filtering/processing. This clip starts with an unfiltered sample followed by one running through the Radio Announcer Voice plugin with a few tweaks.

I like it better. There's something about it that I'd still like to change, but I don't know enough about audio to know what that is. So, it'll work fine for now.
