The default Message Of The Day (MOTD) that shows up when you open a new terminal session on a Mac is something like:

```txt
Last login: Thu May  5 16:38:32 on ttys001
```

I setup a random quote to show when I open a new session and wanted the MOTD to go away. That's done by making a file called `.hushlogin` in your home directory (i.e. `~/.hushlogin`)

You can do that with:

```bash
touch ~/.hushlogin
```

That method makes an empty file which does the job. You can also drop text in there to remind you what the file is for in the future. Mine looks like this:

```txt
The existance of this file prevents the 
MOTD from showing up each time a new
terminal session is started. 
```
