I'm more paranoid than most. I don't like to leave my computer without 'locking' it. I can confirm that the following works on at least my computer running Windows XP Pro. Other Windows versions should work, but I make no promises. YMMV

To get your lock setup:

- Right click on your desktop and select New -> Shortcut
- A dialog box will open that asks you to type the location of the item to make the shortcut for. Copy and past the following into that dialog box:
`%windir%\System32\rundll32.exe user32.dll, LockWorkStation`
- Click next and you will be asked for a name for the new shortcut. Something like "Lock Desktop" will do.
- Click finish and your newly created desktop locker will be sitting on your desktop for you. Just double click it whenever you want to lock your desktop.

This next part is optional. It let's you set a "Hot Key" so you don't have find and double click on the Lock Desktop icon each time you want to close it.

- Right click on the Lock Desktop shortcut that you just created and choose "Properties".
- Click inside the "Shortcut key:" text box and hold down the "Ctrl" and "Alt" keys then hit "L". The text in the box should change to "Ctrl + Alt + L".
- Hit "OK" and you are done.

Now, you can just hit the "Ctrl + Alt + L" key combination to lock your desktop at any time.

To unlock your desktop just hit "Ctrl + Alt + Delete" and enter your password.
