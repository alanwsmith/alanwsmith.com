Oh yeah, and if you look in the lower right corner of the photo, you'll notice my kick ass new logo watermarked on the image. 

For a better view:

<Img src="logo_sample.gif" alt="A vertical, rectangular, black and white logo designed like the opening of a camera iris in the lower right of the logo and the name Alan W Smith aligned vertically on the right side" />

Thanks CJ. 

I owe you some drinks.

_(Update 2022: I have no idea what photo was being reference, but I still love the logo)_
