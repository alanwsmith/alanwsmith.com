An hour or so ago we sent out the e-mail to our private beta user
group to preview our new live scoring product. This is the thing
that I've been working on since like October that has required all
the travel up to Atlanta. I went there a lot during the process
including at least one day every week for the past eight weeks. I'm
so glad I don't have to go again for week nine. That trip was
kicking my ass. There still stuff to do, but the first version is
out the door so I can let off the throttle a little.
