Someone needs to build a sub email address feature. Or, perhaps it
would be called prelude. The way it would work is you have a base
email address that doesn't actually receive any direct mail, but
provides the foundation. To use the email service, you would simply
apply a prefix to the foundation email address. It would be
necessary to allow for this to be done on the fly. The server would
simply forward all the prefixes to the proper foundation address.
For example, a foundation address might be: asmith1@example.com
Then, when you wanted to use an email address on a site you could
do something like siteName-asmith1@example.com All the email from
that site would be easily identified as coming from them.
Especially useful in determining if they sell your address to third
parties. The secondary benefit would be the ability to filter each
email address individually. So, if you made one purchase from the
site that you provided siteName-asmith1@example.com for and you no
longer cared about getting their correspondence, you could simply
tell the server to drop all the incoming emails for that address
into the trash.
