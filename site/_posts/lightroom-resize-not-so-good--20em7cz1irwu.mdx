I've been batching up some photos to get ready to post and was
using Adobe Lightroom to resize them down to the proper dimensions.
Surprisingly, Lightroom isn't actually very good at that. Even with
all the sharpening turned off, I kept getting halos around areas
with high contrast. I couldn't figure out what was going on because
if I export the image full size form Lightroom and then do the
reduction in Photoshop, it looks fine. I've done some digging
around and according to
[this pote](http://forum.adobe.com/webx/.3bc792de) it appears, this
is just the way Lightroom does it, and there is no override. Here's
hoping they work on this to make it better. As a commenter
mentions, Lightroom is supposed to reduce the number of steps in
the workflow.
