I'm cleaning out some old magazines to donate to the library.
Mostly they are photo realeated ones, and going through a '95 copy
of Camera and Darkroom, I found a Nikon fold out ad with three
cameras on it. The camera with the least amount of play was the
[F4s](http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/companies/nikon/htmls/models/htmls/slr88.htm#f4)
which had been out for a while. The one that got the spotlight was
the
[N90s](http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/companies/nikon/htmls/models/htmls/slr9294.htm#f90x).
The one that got middle child position was the
"[E2s](http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/companies/nikon/htmls/models/digitalSLRs/E2E2s/index.htm)"
which, frankly, I don't even remember. Copy says:
*The Digital Nikon*
*The E2s. To look through its viewfinder is to see the future of photography.*
*Picture quality rivals that of film.* *etc...* At 1.4MB I think
the marketers were maybe a little ahead of their time saying the
quality rivals that of film. But marketers will do that, I suppose.
