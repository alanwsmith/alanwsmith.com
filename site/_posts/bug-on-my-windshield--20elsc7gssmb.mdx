To continue with the bug postings, I'm going to move over to an actual insect. 

While driving this weekend I hit a bug going about 45MPH. 

Apparently, he has bug armor because he wasn't the smear that you would expect, but was still well formed and just hanging on the window. 

When I parked, without the wind in his face he walked around a little on the glass before flying off. I don't know if I should be really impressed of scared. Seems like it might be the start of a bug army that is doing some crash testing to check out their battle technology before they start the invasion. 

I managed to get a shot of him before he took off. It's a little washed out since the flash went off. He was a darker in color than the photo makes him out to be.
