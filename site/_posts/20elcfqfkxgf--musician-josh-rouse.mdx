Heard an
[NPR interview](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5230385)
this morning with Josh Rouse about his album that is about to come
out. Really liked both the interview and the music. Looking forward
to the release. There are a couple sample tracks at the link if you
have Real Player installed (which I don't). A favorite quote from
the interview: "The best way to learn Spanish is to take a Spanish
lover".
