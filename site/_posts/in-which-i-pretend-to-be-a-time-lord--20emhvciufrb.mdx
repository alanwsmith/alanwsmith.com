Two days ago, Techno-Geek Nerd Princess<sup>1</sup> make a late afternoon post saying the TARDIS<sup>2</sup> had been spotted at Jacksonville's Downtown ArtWalk. Her actual words were: "SOMEONE NEEDS TO GO TO ARTWALK WITH ME AND TAKE A PICTURE!!!!" 

Alan to the rescue<sup>3</sup>.

We met up, found the TARDIS and chatted a bit with the 17 year old student of Douglas Anderson School of the Arts<sup>7</sup> student named Abby <sup>6</sup>. She built the TARDIS last year when she was in the 11th grade<sup>4</sup>. She was, of course, cool with people taking pictures. I surprised her with my dedication to getting a good TARDIS shot when I broke out my gear. Tripod, light stand, wireless strobe, umbrella. The works<sup>5</sup>. We spent the next hour shooting on and off while letting other folks get their shots as well.

I couldn't be happier with the results.

In case you're wondering where I fall on the geek spectrum, not only did I go through the hassle of setting up a full lighting setup for the shot. You are seeing the first time in 2012 that I've worn a tie. I put it on for the sole purpose of taking these shots. 

If you're interested in finding out how to get the TARDIS to show up at your place, check out the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/tardis.atjacksonville) for details.

_Links and Notes_

1. [Techno-Geek Nerd Princess](http://tgnp.me) - The ramblings of a self-professed internetophile chick. To whom I owe a drink for letting me know the TARDIS was in town. 

2. If you've ever been a fan of [Doctor Who](http://www.bbcamerica.com/doctor-who/) you're already familiar with the TARDIS. For the uninitiated, she's a fantastic time machine who's [bigger on the inside](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l82OCNpgKbQ). Evidence of the prominence in geek society is the extended length of the [TARDIS Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS).

3. Like I wouldn't have gone anyway once I knew the TARDIS was there. 

4. I was no where near ambitious enough to build a TARDIS in high school. Good on her for kicking ass so early in life.

5. I should have shot the lighting setup. I was so excited about the TARDIS I completely forgot. There was nothing special about it. Just an umbrella on a stand with occasional fill light from an on camera strobe. The reason I should have shot it was for the entertainment value of seeing it in the middle of the ArtWalk. 

6. I updated the post with additional info about Abby provided via a commenter below. 

7. [Douglas Anderson School of the Arts](http://www.da-arts.org) - A Jacksonville Public School for students grades 9 through 12 with a desire for intensive study in the arts. That place sounds awesome. My high school wasn't that cool overall, but our band program kicked ass. I'd be a much less intersting person if I hadn't been in it.
