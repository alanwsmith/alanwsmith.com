Sturcturing My URLs

I can totally get behind the idea of dropping extensions from an aesthetic point. I love URLs that look like:

alanwsmith.com/view

but, my take these days is that it's a minority of folks who look at URLs and that for 

- talk about redirects
- talk about set
- talk about browsers hiding the urls
- talk about wondering if folks use it
- talk about shuffling so you have slug-KSUID instead of KSUID-slug just to make the prettier
- talk about moving to a 'posts' directory and how that's freeing since it makes other content types easier to deal with with just a directory structure
