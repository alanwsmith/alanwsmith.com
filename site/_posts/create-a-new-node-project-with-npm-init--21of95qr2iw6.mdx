New node projects can be started by running this in the directory you want to make the project in. 

```bash
npm init
```

That will walk you through a set of questions and setup the package.json file. 


The initialization asks for a license, I don't see how to tell it "None" so I just put in the default and then move it to None in the package.json file after it's created.

Install Jest with:


```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
