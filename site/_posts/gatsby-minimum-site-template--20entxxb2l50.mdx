title: Gatsby Minimum Site Template
type: post
slug: gatsby-minimum-site-template--20entxxb2l50
---

To build a site that isn't cloned off a template repo (e.g. `gatsby-starter-hello-world` or `gatsby-starter-default`), just run this by itself:

    gatsby new
    
Then you can name the project and put in all the stuff you want for it directly. It has a few plugins you can add directly as well. 

Note, this does create an index.js file and an image file and a 404.js file, but it doesn't add anything to your gatsby-config other than what you put into the creation wizard

### Don't Really Need To Use The Below

---



To create the most basic site, use:

    gatsby new markdown_responsive_images https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
    
    
This is the minimal version with no images or other assets that would otherwise get installed with `gatsby new`

    
---

It's also possible to create one manually with:

```
    mkdir my-new-gatsby-site
    cd my-new-gatsby-site
    
    npm init
    
    npm install gatsby react react-dom
    
    # NOTE: This doesn't work right now, because of a version conflict on gatsby and it's router with react
    
    mkdir src
    cd src
    mkdir pages
```
    
Then put this in ./src/pages/index.js
    
```javascript
import React from "react"
    
export default function Home() {
    return <h1>Hello Gatsby!</h1>
}
```

Then you're ready to run this from the `my-new-gatsby-site` directory

```
gatsby develop
```
