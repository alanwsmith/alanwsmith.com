I picked up "The Dark Tower" to read again this weekend. About
halfway through the main character has an encounter with a demon.
The word used to describe it is "succubus". I kinda knew what it
meant, but decided to look it up and found this definition: a demon
assuming female form to have sexual intercourse with men in their
sleep â€” compare incubus Makes sense, but I immediately latched
onto the word incubus as a band name. I had never thought about the
name of the band actually being something. Probably spawns from our
culture where our names tend to be just names and don't mean other
things. Anyway, here's the three definitions that m-w.com has for
the word: [incubus](http://m-w.com/dictionary/incubus) 1: an evil
spirit that lies on persons in their sleep; especially : one that
has sexual intercourse with women while they are sleeping â€”
compare succubus 2: nightmare 3: one that oppresses or burdens like
a nightmare Funny, the things you learn when looking up words you
don't fully understand.
