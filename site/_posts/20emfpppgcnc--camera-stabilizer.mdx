Can't believe in all my years of photography, I've never seen this
before. At least, not that I remember, and I think I would have
remembered. Here is a
[video](http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1041948/1_image_stabilizer_for_any_camera_lose_the_tripod/)
of how to make what is probably a pretty good little stabilizer.
Not as good as a tripod, obviously, but I'm sure is better than
hand holding. Especially in tight spaces. It's nothing more than a
bolt that you attached to the tripod mount of your camera with a
sting attached that has a weight at the other end. You just drop
the weight, step on it and pull up against the sting to provide
some stability. If you are using a lens with image stabilization
built in, you can probably do some pretty long hand held exposures.
