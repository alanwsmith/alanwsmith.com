_Update 2022: The site is now at [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)_


Just stumbled across [Kuler](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel). 

<Img src="adobe_kuler_logo.png" alt="The Adobe Kuler logo which consists of light blue circle that has been moved into an irregular shape with the left side being heavier than the right for the background. On the background are the thick, lowercase letters k and u." />

A little web site/tool that adobe setup for community creation and sharing of color themes. If you are stuck looking for a pallet, give it a shot.
