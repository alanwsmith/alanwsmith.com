I would not have guessed that at age 31 I would learn a new way to
[tie my shoes](http://www.lifeclever.com/index.php/2006/06/22/tie-your-shoes-like-a-magician/).
Thank you, internet for reminding me that you can always learn and
improve. Even if you have been doing something the same way for
most of your life.
