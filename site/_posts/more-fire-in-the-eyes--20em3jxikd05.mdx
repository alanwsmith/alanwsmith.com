Here's another shot of Dave with his eyes on fire. Not one of the picks, but it shows the fire even higher. 

<Img src="dave_fire_eyes_2_2007_06_scan.jpg" alt="A black and white photo of a person kneeling in the corner of a room facing the camera. They are looking up with their shirt off and are wearing black welders goggles which have licks of flame extending off them" />

I should mention that I shot this on IR film. I was using a strobe but the exposure was a complete guess. I'm pretty sure I had never shot infrared with a strobe before and I'm positive I never shot fire in IR before. 

The negs are pretty dense. They're over exposed by two stops or three stops. If I had missed that far in my
guessing with digital it would not have been recoverable. Of course, when you get virtually instant feedback with a histogram, it only would have taken one or two test shots to dial in the exposure.
