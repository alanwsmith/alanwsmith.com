Yet another part of the film world of photography is about to
disappear. Seems
[Polaroid is going to stop producing film](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/08/AR2008020803598.html?hpid=topnews).
Trigger nostalgia. I never had a Polaroid camera myself, but used
Polaroid backs all the time when working on commercial and studio
shoots. I'm glad they mention that part of it in the article. I
don't think that most people know that pros used Polaroids all the
time.
