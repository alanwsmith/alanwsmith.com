I had some problems getting my number transfered over from my
Cingular account to my T-Mobile because an account number was
wrong. I just spent about 10 min with the T-Mobile customer service
rep getting it straightened out and it was quite possibly the best
service call I've ever had. I generally wince at the cost of cell
phone service for how little I talk on the phone, but the
experience with their rep just made me a lot less worried about it.
It's refreshing to see a big company treat their customers well.
There is a bit of contrast to this to me today with a few small
companies here in Jax. I'm going to put down some hardwood floor
(which I've been talking about for a year) and I sent a note to
three local companies yesterday asking for some quotes. Not one of
them got back to me. Thinking about it from a small business
perspective, if just one had gotten back to me they would have a
huge chance of getting my business. Guess they don't understand
that I'm lazy and don't want to have to work in order to give them
my business.
