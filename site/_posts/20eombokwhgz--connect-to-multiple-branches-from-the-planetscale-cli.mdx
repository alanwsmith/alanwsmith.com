title: Connect To Multiple Branches From The PlanetScale CLI
slug: /posts/20eombokwhgz--connect-to-multiple-branches-from-the-planetscale-cli
---

Run the planetscale cli multiple times to connect to different branches:

```shell
# Terminal 1
pscale connect your-database main
```

```shell
# Terminal 2
pscale connect your-database another-branch
```

The first connection will use port `3306` if it's available or another random port if it's not. 

The second connection will use a random port either way.

When the connection is made, the port being used will be output. Fill it in like the following:

```txt
host: 127.0.0.1
port: (whatever port number shows up on the command line)
database: (your database name)
username: root
password: (leave blank)
```
