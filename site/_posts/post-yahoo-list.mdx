I wrote a little script to print out the
[current music set](http://www.alanwsmith.com/songlist/) I have
from Yahoo. This is all pretty new stuff since I had to start over
after installing a new hard drive. I can't be held responsible for
some of the bad stuff since I got a lot of this from playlists. I
mean, 98 Degress, really. What the hell. I don't even like the idea
that anything I listen to could be related to that shit enough to
be on the same playlist. Suggestions are always welcome.
