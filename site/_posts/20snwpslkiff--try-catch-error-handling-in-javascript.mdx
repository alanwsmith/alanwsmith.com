Basic try/catch with JavaScript

```javascript
try {
  try_statements
}
catch (optional_exception_var) {
  catch_statements
}
```

And with `finally` that executes regardless of if an exception was thrown. 

```javascript
try {
  try_statements
}
catch (optional_exception_var) {
  catch_statements
}
finally {
  finally_statements
}
```
