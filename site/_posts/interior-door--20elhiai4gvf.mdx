If you ever wondered what the inside of your car door looks like, it's something like this:

<Img src="car_door_with_panel_off_20060414_210832a.jpg" alt="A photo of a car door that's open with the interior panel removed which exposes the speaker and mechanisms inside the door which are mostly covered by a translucent plastic sheet." />

My outside door handle broke off and I was going to fix it, but it appears to be MUCH harder to replace than the interior handle I did a while back. 

Next step is to figure out how much it would cost at the shop. It's probably worth it to just pay for this one.
