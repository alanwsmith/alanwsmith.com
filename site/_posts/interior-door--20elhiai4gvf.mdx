If you ever wondered what the inside of your car door looks like,
it's probably something like this:

My outside door handle broke off and I was going to fix it, but it
appears to be MUCH harder to replace than the interior handle I did
a while back. Next step is to figure out how much it would cost at
the shop. It's probably worth it to just pay for this one.
