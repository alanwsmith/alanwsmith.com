I have a lot of passwords.... I mean a whole lot. And with what I
do, security is important so they can't all be the same or easy. A
while ago I found a piece of software called "KeePass" that makes
life much easier.  
From their site: "KeePass Password Safe is a free, open-source,
light-weight and easy-to-use password manager for Windows."  
Basically, it let's you have one little file that has it's own
password. Inside that file are all your other passwords.  
A few of the nicer points about it:  
- It's open-source which I'm a big supporter of.  
- It will generate as many passwords for you as you want.  
- The passwords it creates for you aren't likely to be broken
easily. For example: Vb4iTwpRmTX4g  
- When you open the main password database file you can drag and
drop these tough passwords into login boxes. So, you don't have to
even know what your passwords are.  
- The file is really small and you can carry it on a keychain
drive. I do this so I can always have it with me and so I don't
have to leave a copy on my work machine.  
- It's free.
