[this collection of photos](http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2009/01/the_inauguration_of_president.html)
taken on Jan. 20, 2009. The day that Barack Obama was sworn in as
the 44th President of the United States of America. I can not
imagine having to look out over all those people and trying to
speak.
