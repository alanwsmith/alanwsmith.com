title: Set A Specific URL For A Page In Hugo
slug: /posts/20enk2yzibp9--set-a-specific-url-for-a-page-in-hugo

Use `url` in the frontmatter to set a URL regardless of where it is in the file structure.

For example, if you have a file with the path:

    content/storage/2020/alpha.md

With the front matter:

    ---
    title: Example File Move
    url: /omega
    ---
    
It will end up at:

    https://www.example.com/omega/
    
Note that it must start with a `/`. 

TKTKTK: Figure out if trailing slash mattersi
