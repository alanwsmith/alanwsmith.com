There are those times when you just feel good and for me, right now
is one of them. After work I went out with a few fellow employees
and played 9 holes on the Valley course which was pretty fun. But
what really hit the spot was that I splurged and went to Outback
and had an excellent dinner of Steak and a baked potatoe with a
nice salad. Top that with three whiskey drinks that got me to that
point of being really relaxed, but not quite buzzed and I was
pretty well set. Then the ride home, the air was perfect having
just rained a little so that each breath felt nice and clean and
some good tunes. That's a really hard thing to beat.
