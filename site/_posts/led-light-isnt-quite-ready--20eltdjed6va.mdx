I forgot to give an update on
[The Everlasting Light Bulb](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/?p=144).
Unfortunately, the verdict is not so good. The light puts out
roughly the same amount of illumination as a 25 or 30 watt standard
bulb. It's not even close enough to be able to read by. The hue of
the light has a very, very blue cast two it. Doesn't feel like a
daylight balanced, but I haven't put a color meter to it. Either
way, it's not ready for prime time yet. Oh well, it was worth a
shot. I'm sure I'll find some use for it since it's probably going
be around for a few thousand years.
