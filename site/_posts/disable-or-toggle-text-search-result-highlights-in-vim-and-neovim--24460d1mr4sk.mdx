## Turning Highlights Off

Neovim/Vim highlights all the matching results when you do a text search in a file buffer. You can hide the highlights after the search with `:noh` but that's a pain to do every time. To disable them full time, add this to your `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` or `~/.vimrc` config file:

```
set nohlsearch
```

## Toggling Highlights

Another option is to toggle the highlights on and off. Instead of using `set nohlsearch`, this can be done by adding the following to your config file:

```
set hlsearch!
nnoremap <F5> :set hlsearch!<CR>
```

With that in place, hitting `F5` will switch showing highlights on and off. 

## One File Only

You can also run those commands directly in a single file buffer (prepended by a `:`) to apply to just that buffer. That is:

```
:set nohlsearch
```
and 

```
set hlsearch!
nnoremap <F5> :set hlsearch!<CR>
```
