title: Parse An ISO Date In JavaScript
slug: /posts/20tgnu6wcske--parse-an-iso-date-in-javascript
---


The native `Date` JavaScript object can parse ISO style date string. For example, this one without a timezone:

```javascript
const dateString = '2021-11-12T02:03:03'
const dateObject = new Date(dateString)
``` 

That code will produce a date object that will print out this if logged:

```
2021-11-12T07:03:03.000Z
```

Note that the time has moved to Zulu (or GMT) time. That is, the hour shifted from 2 to 7. 

Once the date is parsed, you use functions like:

```javascript
.getFullYear()
.getMonth()
.getDate()
```

And all the other ones [listed here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)


Note, this is done without using `Data.parse()` which is "strongly discouraged due to browser differences and inconsistencies." ([source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse))
