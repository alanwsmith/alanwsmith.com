_NOTE: This post was about a website at nasaimages dot org that's no longer around. The article link with the quote is gone as well. In 2022, the place to go for NASA Images is the official [images.nasa.gov](https://images.nasa.gov/)_


<Img src="apollo_11_on_the_moon.jpg" alt="Astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., lunar module pilot, is photographed during the Apollo 11 extravehicular activity (EVA) on the lunar surface. In the right background is the lunar module. On Aldrin's right is the Solar Wind Composition (SWC) experiment, already deployed. This photograph was taken by astronaut Neil A. Armstrong, commander, with a 70mm lunar surface camera." />


Just discovered the recently launched <strike>NASA Images</strike> web site. 

From <strike>this article</strike>:

> The launch is the first step in a five-year partnership that will add millions of images and thousands of hours of video and audio content, with enhanced search and viewing capabilities and new user features.

How cool is that?!?! 

The design of the site looks like it should be easy to get around. 

I've downloaded a couple and they are decent resolution. My hope is that higher resolution becomes available as
well.
