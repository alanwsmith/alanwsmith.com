[![image](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/moon-photo-297x300.jpg "Duke on the Crater\'s Edge")](http://www.nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~5~5~21684~126445:Duke-on-the-Craters-Edge)Just
discovered the recently launched
[NASA Images](http://www.nasaimages.org/) web site. From
[this article]() that talks about the launch:
*The launch is the first step in a five-year partnership that will add millions of images and thousands of hours of video and audio content, with enhanced search and viewing capabilities and new user features.*
How cool is that?!?! The design of the site looks like it should be
easy to get around. I've downloaded a couple and they are decent
resolution. My hope is that higher resolution becomes available as
well.
