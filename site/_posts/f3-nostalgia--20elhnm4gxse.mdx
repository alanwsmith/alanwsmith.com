I'm watching the move Kalifornia.  
In it one of the characters is a photographer. She is using a Nikon
F3 which was my first real camera and the one that I shot with for
probably 10 years. I've still got it and it's still a fine machine.
Of course, I don't really use it since all I really shoot is
digital. Maybe when I retire or become a full time photographer
again I'll bring it back out.  
In the movie the camera has a motor drive attached. To the sound
designers credit, they actually recorded the sound of an F3 with an
MD-4 drive on it. Most movies I've seen when a photographer is
shooting, the sound is from a completely different camera.
