I switched over most of the lights in my house to compact
fluorescent light bulbs a while ago. I've been quite pleased with
them though the ones I got do have a touch of a green tint when.
There are several lights that I didn't switch over though, because
I have dimmer switches installed. Until recently, CFLs didn't work
with dimmers, but new ones came out at the end of last year that
are designed for dimmers. I haven't tried them yet, but I'm
dropping a link to them
[here](http://www.1000bulbs.com/14-to-15-Watt-Dimmable-Compact-Fluorescents/)
to get some. The other thing I'm doing is finally switching out the
bulbs in my office to daylight balanced. In case I ever do any
printing I can at least be sure that the fact that my colors are
off has nothing to do with the lights that I'm under. Just that I'm
not very good at color balance.
