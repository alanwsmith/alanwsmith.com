For all those Windows users out there that want to play around with
Linux (or develop on it like I do), the fine folks at
[VMWare](http://www.vmware.com/) have release
[VMWare Player](http://www.vmware.com/products/player/). The
software lets you run a "Virtual Machine" inside your computer. You
can install from a bunch of options, but I'm a fan on the linux one
since you can have your own little linux server sitting in your
Windows machine.

If you develop for the web (and your web server is a linux box)
this is very handy because you can have a development/testing
server sitting inside your work machine.

Just awesome.... (And yes, I'm that much of a geek)
