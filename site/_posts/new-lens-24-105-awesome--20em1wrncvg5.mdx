Not too long ago, Canon introduced a new lens: the
[EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=149&modelid=11924).
I've been lusting after this lens from the day I first heard about
it. When I was shooting with my old Nikon F3, I would generally
carry two lenses. A 24mm and a 105mm. Now, I can have them both in
a single lens. Granted, my prime lenses were of the f/2.8 variety
which would have been nice, but loosing one stop in light is worth
it for keeping the lens a manageable size and weight. Last
Saturday, I was shooting a wedding for some friends so I decided to
finally break down and get the lens before the big day. From that
experience, I think the lens is just about the perfect lens for
wedding photography. On the wide side, a 28mm angle of view would
have been just fine, but the 105mm is just right. I've always loved
the perspective. It keeps enough of the background so you can
figure out what's going on, but has a narrow enough depth of field
to keep it from competing. Prior to getting this lens my main lens
was a 28-70 f/28. And while I love having the extra stop of light
for shooting bands (main venue where I shoot the lighting generally
rings in at 1/15 - f/2.8 at ISO 800) the 70mm perspective just
isn't telephoto enough for what I like. Of course, I could always
switch over to the 80-200, but when running and gunning this is so
much of a hassle that I wouldn't do it unless the shot really
needed it. Now, I don't have to worry. This is my first Image
Stabalization lens and I haven't really used it yet at all. Just
turned it on for a couple of test shots. It was a little
disorienting since it creates a bit of a disconnect between what
you feel in the camera movement in your hands and what is going on
in the viewfinder. I'm sure it'll be nice to have, but it'll
probably take me a while to remember it's there. My only minor
gripe is the fact that the lens hood is only effective at the wide
end of the range. A nice thing about the 28-70 is that it moves to
wide as the front is extended. This means that the hood works well
the 70mm angle of view as well. Not a huge deal most of the time,
but it would be nice if the 24-105 had similar working
functionality. Bottom line. After one day of shooting with it, I'm
very happy with the lens.
