[Fun link](http://drunkard.com/issues/02_05/02-05_on_the_cuff.htm).
Haven't had a chance to go thru it all yet, but what I have is
interesting. I don't know if the first statement, "There are more
slang words for inebriation than there are for any other word in
the English language.", holds true, but it's probably not too far
form the mark. I would guess there are more slang words for sex,
but either way. Still a fun page to go thru.
