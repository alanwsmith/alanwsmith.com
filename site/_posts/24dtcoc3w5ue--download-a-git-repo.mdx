This is a bit of a hack, but to download a git repo into your current directory you can do:

```
git init 
git remote add origin https://github.com/alanwsmith/ideas.alanwsmith.com
git fetch 
git checkout main
rm -rf .git
```

The reason you might want to use this over `git clone` is because you can do it in your current directory. The `git clone` command clones the repo down into a sub directory.
