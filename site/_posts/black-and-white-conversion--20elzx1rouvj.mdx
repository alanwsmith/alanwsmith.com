The ability to easily convert from color to black and white is one
of my favorite things about digital photography. Most of the time
when I used to shoot film it would be black and white. Part of this
was because it was less expensive, but i also just liked it better.
Using photoshop, I was never really happy with just converting to
grayscale to make an image black and white. It always looked flat
to me. Back about photoshop 3 or 4, I discovered that you could use
the "Channels" of the color image to pull a black and white image
from the color and get better results. I especially liked the red
channel which had a tendency to look a lot like infrared. These
days I use a channel mixer adjustment layer to do my conversions.
After setting the channel mixer to "Monochrome" by marking the
checkbox at the bottom, I set the following: Red: 70% Green: 15%
Blue: 15% This makes a balance of the skin tones that I like a lot.
If the specific image has a lot of green or blue in it you might
have to tweak it some, but it's a good base level to start with.
The last thing I do is make a curves adjustment layer and bring up
the midtones just a little. Say something like an Input of "75" and
and output of "85" to add just a little more punch to it. If you
haven't played with the channel mixer before to do black and white
conversions, give it a try.
