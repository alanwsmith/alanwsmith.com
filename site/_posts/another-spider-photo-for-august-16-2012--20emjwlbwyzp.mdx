<Img src="another_spider_aws_20120816_0950.jpg" alt="A photo of the side of a house showing a big spider in the foreground on the side of the wall and a sconce light on the right side of the frame which is around the corder" />

Other than "Giant", I'm still trying to figure out what type of spider this is. Any insight is appreciated. Especially if it's deadly.
