title: A Flexible Responsive Image Solution for Hugo

slug: a-flexible-responsive-image-solution-for-hugo--20en8rdqh5do
---

While moving my site, I wanted to come up with a better way to handle images. My goal was to design a setup where the images look good on desktops, tablets, and phones. Something that's known as "Responsive Images" in the web industry. The software I moved to doesn't do it out of the box, but with some research, I was able to hack together a solution.

My goals were:

- Store all my images in a single directory
- Store the images at their full size
- Setup so devices don't download images larger than they need in order to make pages load faster
- Automatically resize the image files for different devices to they don't download files that are larger than they need
- Setup so that smaller images are rendered as big as they can be without up-sizing them.
- Prevent images larger than the necessary size from being generated or made available


The code I came up with is:

```html{numberLines: true}
{{ $img_src := .Get "src" }}
{{ $alt_text := .Get "alt"}}
{{ $caption_text := .Get "caption" }}

{{ with .Site.GetPage "/01-images" }}
  {{ $src := .Resources.GetMatch $img_src }}

  {{ $raw_image_width := $src.Width }}

  {{ $.Scratch.Set "figure_max_width" $raw_image_width }}
  {{ if ge ($.Scratch.Get "figure_max_width") 680 }}
    {{ $.Scratch.Set "figure_max_width" 680 }}
  {{ end }}

  {{ $raw_resize_string := (printf "%d%s" $raw_image_width "x")  }}

  {{ $original_size := $src.Resize $raw_resize_string }}

  {{ $image_sizes := slice 680 1000 1400 1800 2648 }}

  <div class="image_wrapper">
    <figure style='max-width: {{ $.Scratch.Get "figure_max_width" }}px;'>

        <img srcset='
          {{ $original_size.RelPermalink }} {{ $raw_image_width }}w
          {{ range $image_sizes }}
            {{ if ge $raw_image_width . }}
              ,
              {{ $resized_image := $src.Resize (printf "%d%s" . "x") }}
              {{ $resized_image.RelPermalink }} {{ (printf "%d%s" . "w") }}
            {{ end}}
          {{ end }}
        '>

      {{ if $caption_text}}
        <figcaption>
          {{ $caption_text }}
        </figcaption>
      {{ end }}

    </figure>
  </div>
{{ end }}
```

Usage:

- Need the style sheet setup (your using Tale with some modifications, but this should work)
- First create a folder and associated index file to house all the images (e.g. "content/01-images/index.md" )
- Store any images inside the folder (e.g. "content/01-images/cat-photo.jpg")
- Call it with:
