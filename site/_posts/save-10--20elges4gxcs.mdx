Since my early 20s I've been trying to increase my knowledge of
money and how money works. A main goal is to be able to retire
sooner rather than later. More importantly, I want to make sure
that if I loose or quit my job later in life that I don't have to
worry about finding another one.

In this search for knowledge I've read a decent number of books
across several financial topics. Investing, personal finance,
financial planning, etc... I think that one of the best ones is
also one of the simplest,
"[The Richest Man in Babylon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451205367/sr=8-2/qid=1143168033/ref=pd_bbs_2/002-2428558-2432022?_encoding=UTF8)"
by George S. Clason.

Your local library might have it, but if not, it's worth picking
up. It helps drive home the fact that you are going to have to take
care of yourself when it comes to your money and that in order to
do this you have to save. The central idea of the book is to save
10% of everything you earn. The book does a great job of showing
you how to think about this and had answers to all my natural
reactions.

I want to make sure that everyone I know can get to the point where
they are working because they want to and not because they have to
and I think this book is a huge step in the right direction. It's a
very simple idea, but powerful ones often are.
