To Add

Copy in track from IntroMusic starting at the top alphabetically
- Put up the note on the video that it's raw and any explicit words aren't taken out and there are ums and ahs and sometimes repeating things for new takes. Most of the time it's straight through (figure out how much to put in the title card and how much to put in the video description)



TODO: Redo these notes to:

- Put in new file locations and naming conventions
- Don't put music in youtube video. Only do the title card
- Do the audio editing in a multitrack session on


Assembly Checklist

- Normalize audio of music track to `-6.8dB` (Right click - Audio Gain Normalize Max Peak to: -6.8dB)
- Normalize audio of main track to `-3dB` (Right click - Audio Gain Normalize Max Peak to: -3dB)
- Fade out the music by cutting the track to around 12 seconds and starting a fade from when you start speaking with (Effects - Audio Transitions - Crossfade - Exponential Fade)
- Add Effects - Video Transitions - Dissolve - Dip To Black to front of clip
- Add Effects - Video Transitions - Dissolve - Dip To Black to end of clip

TODO: Build a script that does the upload stuff.


- Do stream setup:
- Click to Record instead of stream
- Stop and restart before doing aftershows
- Move clips to podcast directory
- Trim video and add fade-in and fade-out in premier
- Normalize audio to `-3dB` in Premiere (Right click - Audio Gain - Normalize Max Peak to -3dB)
- Make Black and White:

Effects -> Video Effects -> Color Correction -> Lumetri Color

and dropping the effect on the clip

Then I mess around with the parameters with the following adjustment starting points:

- Saturation: 0
- Exposure: 0.7
- Highlights: 22.8
- Blacks: -19.3

Then 

- Add Vignette 
    - Amount: -3.0
    - Midpoint: 50
    - Roundness: 100
    - Feather: 100

- Export Media - Format: H.264 - Preset Match Source
