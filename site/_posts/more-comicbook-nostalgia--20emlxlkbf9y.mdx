[![image](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/scarlett.jpg "scarlett")](http://www.hasbro.com/gijoe/default.cfm?page=News/Item&newsid=1184AF5F-D56F-E112-4CC4AA47161E7DF4)Just
discovered that yet another old comic-book/cartoon world is being
brought back to cash in on gen-x nostalgia. This time, it's
[G.I. Joe](http://tinyurl.com/5x4utx). Scarlett certainly looks
great, but with Brendan Fraser as Gung Ho, I'm apprehensive. I will
give them credit for making Snake Eyes look bad ass. Hadn't thought
about it in a long time, but the main comic book I remember reading
as a kid was [Issue 21](http://tinyurl.com/2t9axr) of G.I. Joe (I
had to look up the number). While I wasn't a huge comic book geek,
that one blew me away. Snake Eyes being the main character
certainly helped, but the real reason was that it didn't have any
words in it at all. Stands out in my mind as one of the first times
that I realized that conventions didn't always have to be followed.
