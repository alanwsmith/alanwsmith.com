I don't really do anything at all with video, but the idea of
having a camera that can shoot high speed stuff is way fun. Back in

[announced](http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,141079/article.html)
an upcoming SLR that it says will shoot 60 full rez frames a second
which is wild. Also, they state it'll do up to 1,200 fps in video
mode. All this for about $1,000 which is not too far away from
basic entry into the digital SLR market. I'm guessing we'll be
seeing a lot more stuff on youtube in the next couple of years that
were shot in high-speed so they have the slow-motion effect.
Especially people shooting things, like in this one:
Another very interesting thing to consider is the impact of the 60
frames/second at full resolution. The impact on sports photography
for example could be huge. Instead of trying to nail
[The Decisive Moment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Cartier-Bresson#The_Decisive_Moment)
all you'll need to do is play back the shots/video frame by frame
and pick the best one. This is the first camera that I'm aware of
where photo type resolution (like enough to print 8x10s) is able to
be capture at video rates. In fact at 60 frames/second, it's
basically double standard motion picture frame rates. Wild.
