This is from an old set of notes I found. Need to check out the kill all command to verify it's still accurate. 


### Kill A Named Session

```command
tmux kill-session -t $NAME_OF_SESSION
```

    


### Kill All Sessions from Command Line

```command
tmux ls | grep : | cut -d. -f1 | awk '{print substr($1, 0, length($1)-1)}' | xargs kill
```
