The basic React and React Router tutorials were a confusing for me. So, here's mine. It shows only the contents require for each file without all the cruft. 

NOTE: This sets up so that URLs are available to be used client-side but doesn't address server-side rendering. That means that if you bookmark a URL other than the site root (e.g. `https://www.example.com/about`) the server will send a its version of a 404 page not found response. See [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36623117/102401) for more details.

NOTE: Right now, I'm not going through step by step showing the pieces, this is just my copy showing me what the end states of each file are. 

NOTE: I use Prettier for formatting that removes ending semi-colons. If you're code has them, that's likely the difference

This tutorial shows you step by step what to do with full copies of each file that's edited for reference after each step. It makes the page long, but I find it's the easiest way to keep track of what's going on. 

I also break things as I go forward. It's a bit like TDD where I intentionally do things like calling files/components before we make them. This helps get used to error messages and makes sure we know the changes we're making line up with what we expect to happen

I call the imports in the order we use them. I'd organize them a little differently in production, but I find this is easier to track for a tutorial

## Installation   

Start by running

```bash
npx create-react-app site
cd site
npm install react-router-dom@6
npm start
```

That'll get the router installed and spin up the dev version of the site. 

## Removing reportWebVitals

I generally don't use `reportWebVitals` so I remove these lines from index.js. 

```jsx
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals'
```

```jsx
// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals()
```

So the index.js file looks like this:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import './index.css'
import App from './App'

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
)
```

## Clear out the App.js file

To provide a clean slate, remove all the initial placeholder code from the `App.js` file so it looks like this. 

We'll also add in an `<Outlet />` and it's import which will let other pages show up further below. (We'll also include the import statement for the `Link` which will use further below as well)

```jsx
import { Outlet, Link } from 'react-router-dom'

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```




## Add Browser Router

Make these adjustments to `index.js` (Nothing visible will change with these alterations. They just get us set up for the rest of the changes)

Add the import 

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
```

And change this:

```jsx
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
```

To this:

```jsx
  <React.StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<App />}>
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </React.StrictMode>
```

So the file looks like:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import './index.css'
import App from './App'

import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<App />}>
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </React.StrictMode>
)
```


## Add a home page component

This step calls a HomePage component we haven't created yet which results in an error that we expect to see. The call is done by adding an import call to the HomePage component 

```jsx
import HomePage './HomePage'
```

And then this route:

```jsx
<Route index element={<HomePage />} />
```

So the `index.js` file looks like this:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import './index.css'
import App from './App'

import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'

import HomePage from './HomePage'

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<App />}>
          <Route index element={<HomePage />} />
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </React.StrictMode>
)
```

The error will see starts out with this followed by a bunch of other stuff

```txt
Compiled with problems:X

ERROR in ./src/index.js

Module build failed... 
```

## Add the HomePage.js file

To fix the error, create a `HomePage.js` file next to the `App.js` and `index.js` files with this content:


```jsx
function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Home Page</h2>
    </div>
  )
}

export default HomePage
```

That will get the Home Page header showing up below the "Hello, world" from the `<App />` component. 

The way this works is that the `<Outlet />` in the `<App />` file outputs the contents of the `<HomePage />` component. 

This happens because the `<Route ... />` for the HomePage is inside the one for the App. 

Because the HomePage `<Route ... />` contains the work `index` it means that it shows up when there is nothing paste the last `/` in the URL. 


## Add link to content page

TODO: Fill out details - there's also a link to the home page that just takes us back to the same page to get us ready for later

Clicking the link doesn't show anything 

```jsx
import { Outlet, Link } from 'react-router-dom'

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      <div>
        <Link to="/">Home Page</Link>
      </div>
      <div>
        <Link to="/content">Content Home Page</Link>
      </div>
      <div>
        <Link to="/content/1">Content Page 1</Link>
      </div>
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

## Add content route

This will break things since it doesn't exist yet. TODO: put in note at the end about how you can add a wrapper for the content too by adding an element to the `<Route path="content" />`


```jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import './index.css'
import App from './App'

import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'

import HomePage from './HomePage'
import ContentHomePage from './ContentHomePage'

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<App />}>
          <Route index element={<HomePage />} />
          <Route path="content"}>
            <Route index element={<ContentHomePage />}></Route>
          </Route>
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </React.StrictMode>
)
```

## Make the Content element


file: `ContentHomePage.js`


```jsx
function ContentHomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Content Home Page</h2>
    </div>
  )
}

export default ContentHomePage
```

At this point you can click the links back and forth. 


## Add dynamic pages

this will break

Add

```jsx
<Route path=":contentId" element={<ContentPage />} />
```

To get:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import './index.css'
import App from './App'

import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'

import HomePage from './HomePage'
import ContentHomePage from './ContentHomePage'
import ContentPage from './ContentPage'

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<App />}>
          <Route index element={<HomePage />} />
          <Route path="content">
            <Route index element={<ContentHomePage />}></Route>
            <Route path=":contentId" element={<ContentPage />} />
          </Route>
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </React.StrictMode>
)
```

## Create the initial content page


```jsx
function ContentPage() {
  return (

      <h2>Content Page</h2>
    </div>
  )
}

export default ContentPage
```

Then add the dynamic stuff to it:

```jsx
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom'

function ContentPage() {
  let params = useParams()
  return (
    <div>
        <h2>This is content page: {params.contentId}</h2>
    </div>
   )
}

export default ContentPage
```


## Add 404 page:

```
<Route path="*" element={<div>404 goes here</div>} />
```

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import './index.css'
import App from './App'

import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'

import HomePage from './HomePage'
import ContentHomePage from './ContentHomePage'
import ContentPage from './ContentPage'

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<App />}>
          <Route index element={<HomePage />} />
          <Route path="content">
            <Route index element={<ContentHomePage />}></Route>
            <Route path=":contentId" element={<ContentPage />} />
          </Route>
          <Route path="*" element={<div>TODO: 404 goes here</div>} />
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </React.StrictMode>
)
```
