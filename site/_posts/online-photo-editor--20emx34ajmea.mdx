I haven't given it a spin, but this looks interesting:
[picknik.com](http://www.picnik.com/). An online photo editor that
can tie into other sources like flickr for images. While I don't
have a lot of interest in using something like this myself, it
might make a nice tool for someone less heavily into photography.
If it's simple enough, it might also be a nice transition for
someone who's not that computer savvy as well. That could make for
a smoother transition for those folks that are still hanging onto
their file point and shoot cameras.
