### Starting with Pagination

Started the stream by looking at Hugo's pagination. Was thinking about setting up my indexes to be based off the year. Played around for a bit, but didn't find a quick solution. Decided instead of just adjust the number of items on each time. That's done simply enough in the config file with:

> paginate=60


### 18:30 - Twitter Social Card

The process here was to add in the HTML meta tags that Twitter looks for to produce the cards on its site.

In the video, I used `{{ .URL }}` in the header. This caused this warning from hugo when building the site:

> WARN 2020/10/01 12:31:13 Page.URL is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use .Permalink or .RelPermalink. If what you want is the front matter URL value, use .Params.url
