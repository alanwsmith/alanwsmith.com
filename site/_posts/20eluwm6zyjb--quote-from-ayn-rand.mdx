Last week, I finally started on a book that Traivs had suggested.

Came upon a nice quote by Ayn Rand's character Kent Lansing in The Fountainhead: 

> "Men are brothers, you know, and they have a great instinct for brotherhood - except in boards, unions, corporations and other chain gangs." 

Didn't know a thing about the book before I started reading it, which is my preferred way to go into something. If I have been given 20 guesses I never would have come up with Architecture as being a main element.
