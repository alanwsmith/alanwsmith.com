### Under Consideration 

<ReadOnlyChecklist data={`
0, Figure out why redirects aren't in place for everything (e.g. 20eMTNPwHx1B) - Probably it's just that it doesn't work in dev and only works on deploy, but see if you can get it working in dev
0, Find "tr.im" Urls and replace them
0, Change status markers in nvAlt post files from "unpublished", "scratch", "draft", "published" to "u", "s", "d", and "p" just so you have to type the words. Could also put a legend in the rest of the YAML to make sure you remember 
0, Make sure all pages have canonacial IDs in their metadata
