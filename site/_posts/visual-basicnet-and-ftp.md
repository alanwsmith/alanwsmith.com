I'm messing around with a little Visual Basic.NET. It seems that
there is no native FTP functionality in it. That just sucks as it's
what I need to do. There is a set of example code that microsoft
has on their site
[here](http://support.microsoft.com/?scid=kb;EN-US;832679), that
i'm starting to experiment with. There is one error in the code,
but I've at least gotten it to connect..... Good thing the internet
is here.
