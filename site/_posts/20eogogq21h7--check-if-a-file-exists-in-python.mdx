title: Check If A File Exists In Python

TL:DR;

    from pathlib import Path
    
    my_file = Path("/path/to/file")
    if my_file.is_file():
        # file exists
    
    # oneliner:
    
    if Path("/path/to/file").is_file()
        print('file exists.)
        
For dir:

    .is_dir()

Exists in general:

    .exists()

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the reason you're checking is so you can do something like `if file_exists: open_it()`, it's safer to use a `try` around the attempt to open it. Checking and then opening risks the file being deleted or moved or something between when you check and when you try to open it.

If you're not planning to open the file immediately, you can use [`os.path.isfile`][1]

> Return `True` if path is an existing regular file. This follows symbolic links, so both [islink()][2] and [isfile()][1] can be true for the same path.

    import os.path
    os.path.isfile(fname) 

if you need to be sure it's a file.

Starting with Python 3.4, the [`pathlib` module][3] offers an object-oriented approach (backported to `pathlib2` in Python 2.7):

    from pathlib import Path
    
    my_file = Path("/path/to/file")
    if my_file.is_file():
        # file exists

To check a directory, do:

    if my_file.is_dir():
        # directory exists

To check whether a `Path` object exists independently of whether is it a file or directory, use `exists()`:

    if my_file.exists():
        # path exists

You can also use `resolve(strict=True)` in a `try` block:

    try:
        my_abs_path = my_file.resolve(strict=True)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        # doesn't exist
    else:
        # exists
