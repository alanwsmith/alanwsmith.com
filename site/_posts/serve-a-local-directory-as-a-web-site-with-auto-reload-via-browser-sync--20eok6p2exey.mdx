title: Serve A Local Directory As A Web Site With Auto-Reload via browser-sync
slug: serve-a-local-directory-as-a-web-site-with-auto-reload-via-browser-sync--20eok6p2exey

Install with:

```
npm install -g browser-sync
```

Then CD into the directory you want to serve and do this:

```bash
browser-sync . -w --no-notify
```

That will serve the directory with the watch files flag set which makes the browser reload automatically on changes. 

The `--no-notify` turns off a banner that would otherwise flash during each update

Old Notes

You can serve a local directory as a web site by running this inside it:

```command
npx browser-sync start --server --files "./**/*.html" --no-open --no-notify --directory
```

This will automatically reload the browser if it seems any of the .html files change. 

The site is served at both:

```
http://localhost:3000
http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:3000
```

Use ngrok if you need to show it to folks externally by running this (doesn't have to be in the same directory):

```command
ngrok http 3000
```

There's also a UI that gives you some details at:

```
http://localhost:3001
http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:3001
```

You'll need `npx` installed which should come with node. 

It'll install browser-sync the first time you run it if it's not already there.
