Peace.

My mind at ease.

In a way I've never experienced before.

But, in a way that's still me.

Not a me dulled or altered or bent into a shape that's not my own.

Just me, but...

...

Quiet, perhaps is better.

That's it too.

But, not a lack of sound. A lack of commotion.

Like looking away from a crowd.

Watching instead the gentle motion of a breeze.

Or, perhaps a ship.

But, not one becalmed.

One harbored in an easy port after rough seas.

Seas ridden so long, I had memories of nothing else.
