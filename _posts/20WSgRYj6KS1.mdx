Catching up on some stuff in my news reader, I saw a post about the
[Consumer Action Handbook](http://www.consumeraction.gov/) from the
Federal Citizen Information Center. Put out by the Federal
government, the intro say:
> This everyday guide to being a smart shopper is hot off the press
> and chocked full of helpful tips about buying a car or home,
> preventing identity theft, understanding credit,filing a consumer
> complaint, and much more. In the 2008 edition, you'll find updated
> information about filing for bankruptcy, finding a lawyer, and
> planning a funeral, along with many other useful topics.

You can order a printed copy, or download a pdf on the
[download page](http://www.consumeraction.gov/viewpdf.shtml).
