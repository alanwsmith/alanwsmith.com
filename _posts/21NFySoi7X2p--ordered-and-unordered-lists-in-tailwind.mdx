title: Ordered And Unordered Lists In Tailwind
slug: /posts/21nfysoi7x2p--ordered-and-unordered-lists-in-tailwind

[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) removes most styling by default. This including removing discs and numbers from `<ul>` and `<ol>` lists. I bring them back with this:

```css
ul {
    @apply list-disc;
    @apply pl-5;
    @apply pb-2;
}
ol {
    @apply list-decimal;
    @apply pl-5;
    @apply pb-2;
}
li {
    @apply pb-5;
}
```

That goes in my `styles/global.css` file in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I expect similar works on other platforms, but your milage may vary. 

Oh yeah, the lists look like this:

- Secondly. It appears that the same active and leading members of the council had been active.
- If the periods be separated by short intervals, the measures to be reviewed and rectified will have been of recent date, and will be connected with all the circumstances which tend to vitiate and pervert the result of occasional revisions. 
- Two of the members had been vice-presidents of the State, and several other members of the executive council, within the seven preceding years. One of them had been speaker, and a number of others distinguished members, of the legislative assembly within the same period.

And

1. Although they might not have been personally concerned in the administration, and therefore not immediately agents in the measures to be examined, they would probably have been involved in the parties connected with these measures, and have been elected under their auspices.
2. In the first place, a distant prospect of public censure would be a very feeble restraint on power from those excesses to which it might be urged by the force of present motives.
3. This conclusion cannot be invalidated by alleging that the State in which the experiment was made was at that crisis, and had been for a long time before, violently heated and distracted by the rage of party. Is it to be presumed, that at any future septennial epoch the same State will be free from parties?
