Start nvim with `-V9FILENAME`, e.g. 

    nvim -V9_debug.log file_to_edit.txt
    
Via: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3025615/is-there-a-vim-runtime-log

The `9` is the log level. Not sure what the other levels are or do

And these are the log levels according to [this page](https://inlehmansterms.net/2014/10/31/debugging-vim/)


" >= 1  When the viminfo file is read or written.
" >= 2  When a file is ":source"'ed.
" >= 5  Every searched tags file and include file.
" >= 8  Files for which a group of autocommands is executed.
" >= 9  Every executed autocommand.
" >= 12 Every executed function.
" >= 13 When an exception is thrown, caught, finished, or discarded.
" >= 14 Anything pending in a ":finally" clause.
" >= 15 Every executed Ex command (truncated at 200 characters).
