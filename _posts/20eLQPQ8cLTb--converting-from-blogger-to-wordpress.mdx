TODO: Figure out why this isn't working in MDX

A script called import-blogger.php came along with the default
install of version 1.5.2 of WordPress. This didn't work on my
system (which I'll explain in a sec), but after searching around
[I found a solution for importing blogger.com entries along with their comments](http://www.skeltoac.com/2005/03/12/from-blogger-to-wordpress-2/).
I recommend you use that process if you want to do the same thing.
I wouldn't be at all surprised if that becomes the next official
version of the script. For those of you who want to use the one
that comes with the default install you may run into a problem with
a PHP setting called "register\_globals". A lot of hosting
companies turn that setting off for security reasons, but the
import script expects it to be on. You should be able to change
line 21 From this: switch ($action) { to this: switch
($\_GET\['action'\]) { in order to get the script to work in an
environment with register\_globals turned off. Once again, I would
really recommend using the
[updated version](http://www.skeltoac.com/2005/03/12/from-blogger-to-wordpress-2/).

It is setup correctly for register\_globals and pulls comments as
well.
