title: I dont know about you but Im tired of the Terror
---

I'm hoping that eventually the "always looking for the next thing"
spirit will move us away from the constant Terror, Terror, Terror
thing, but that may be wishful thinking. By and large, I agree with
this article and hope that We All can stop harping on this shit so
much. But, ratings are ratings and fear sells where sex won't (or
is at least heavily frowned upon), so I don't know how likely it is
in the near future.
