TODO: Figure out why this isn't working in MDX


The Four Links for today are centered on the Space Shuttle Endeavour and allude to the creativity and problem solving of human-kind. In sharp contrast is today's video showing some of the destructive power of mother nature. This video was shot from the building I used to work in. My heart goes out to all those hit by this all the other disasters of recent times. To T-Town especially, here's hoping for a quick recovery and a somber Roll Tide to say I'm thinking about you.
