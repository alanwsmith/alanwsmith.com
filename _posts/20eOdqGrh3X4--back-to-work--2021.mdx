How many words is 1,600 words. 

I mean. that's actually kinda obvious. 

But, like, how much does it weight in terms or writing and the mental energy it takes to put pen to paper?

Why the wondering? 

It's NaNoWriMo (aka National Novel Writing Month). Happens every November. 

The website is [here](https://nanowrimo.org/)

I'm not interesting in writing a novel, but i'm interesting in writing again. So, figure it's a good prompt. It's the second of the month, so I missed yesterday, but I made a huge text blog post that I'm gonna count. Today, this is it.

Oh, yeah. The number. The goal of NaNoWriMo is to write 50,000 words of a novel during the month. Since there's thirty days in the month, that comes out to 1,666.6 words per day. (1,600 just  sounds better than 1,700. Fewer syllables for the win.)

So, imma do it. I'm going to write at least 1,600 words per day. (Again, not for a novel, but just to write)

Right now I'm in my journaling software. Seems I didn't journal once in either September or October which is a sign that my mental health hasn't been the best. That changed today when I went back into the office. 

I didn't realize how much I missed (and need) human contact. 

Like, it was instant. Even before I got to the office, just getting ready in the morning, I felt better. My brain moving in a way that it never has before. That's not being dramatic. The last time I was in the office (prior to the pandemic shutting everything down), I was still recovering from my bipolar depression. Prior to that was the mania and prior to that, I was un-medicated. 

This is all new to me. 

I like it.

Okay, about that 1,600 words thing... That's not gonna happen. The above is 304 words. It's 11:50PM and I streamed for a few hours after a full day at work. 

Even without all that, I wouldn't have been interested in going to 1,600 now that I know how many words that actually is.
