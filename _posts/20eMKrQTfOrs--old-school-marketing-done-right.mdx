Large companies often run sweepstakes or contests offering a a
prize in exchange for filling out a form or making a purchase. The
odds of winning one seem about as remote as hitting the lottery.
The prizes? Generally tchotchkes. Overall, not very enticing. The
photo web site
[Luminous Landscape](http://www.luminous-landscape.com/) has run a
few contests and just announced their most recent one. Unlike their
rote corporate siblings, the Luminous Landscape ones have a
refreshing feel. To start with, the site's ambiance is much more
like a small labor of love than a monster corporate site. The
natural implication is significantly fewer visitors than the big
boys meaning there is at least a slightly better chance of winning.
Still probably measured in the thousands, there's not that great a
chance, but it's way better than when there are a few million other
folks entered with you. They aren't screwing around with their
prizes either. The latest contest is
[Win The lens of Your Choice](http://www.luminous-landscape.com/about/summer08-contest.shtml).
There is a little fine print, but most of it is in bold near the
top: Any Lens For Any Camera Valued Up To $2,000. So, you can't get
a $6,800, 12 pound,
[400mm f/2.8 L IS USM](http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-400mm-f-2.8-L-IS-USM-Lens-Review.aspx),
the $2,000 limit is more than reasonable, and will allow for the
vast majority of lenses to be in play. And let's face it, while I'd
LOVE to have one of those lenses, it's way down the list for the
type of shooting I do. Two other refreshing aspects: 1) the fact
the reason for the contest ("To entice you to purchase one of our
products") is put right out there in front, and 2) the way to enter
is to purchase something that is actual of value. I've been
interested in one of the tutorial offerings (called
"[From Camera To Print](http://www.luminous-landscape.com/videos/camera-print.shtml)")
for a while, but never pulled the trigger. I haven't been shooting
that much recently because of my work schedule and at almost 7
hours, it's a pretty big tutorial. I probably would have ended up
getting it at some point, but adding the (remote) possibility of
winning a new lens is enough to make the purchase. Chalk one up for
marketing strategy. A final note, I appreciate the upfront 'no
purchase necessary' statement:
> And finally, to satisfy the law in some countries â€“ no purchase

If this was a big company, I'd consider the no purchase option.
Since it's more of a guy running a site on a subject he's
passionate about, there's no way I would do that.
