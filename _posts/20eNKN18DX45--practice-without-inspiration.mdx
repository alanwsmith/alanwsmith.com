The only reason I'm writing this is because writing first thing is what I do. 

Some people do yoga. I do this. 

I'm not inspired. I'm writing because I decided it's what I do. It's practicing my ritual.

The practice is the thing. There is no performance. Well, I guess that's not entirely true since I live stream writing. But, that's just practice with an audience. 

With music, there was a distinct separation between practice and performance. That distinction doesn't exist here. Something I'm just beginning to get my head around.

Because I'm not inspired, I don't really know where to go with this, but that doesn't matter. I've put in my practice. Sometimes, it goes better than others. Sometimes, not. Doesn't matter either way. Doing it does.
