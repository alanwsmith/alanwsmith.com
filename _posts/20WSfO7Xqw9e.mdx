A little while back, the interior door handle for my driver side
door broke off. I used super glue a couple of times and it held for
longer than I though, but I ended up getting a new handle and
replacing it. Last week, the exterior handle cracked so that the
part you pull up on is no longer attached to the rest of the
mechanism. I can still get in, but it takes two hands and a little
time. Seems \~165,000 miles of opening doors is about all they
could take. I've got the part now and am about to dig into my door
panel yet again. Between the times I've replaced the speakers (once
with CJ and a couple times without) and the door handles I'm
getting pretty good at removing the panel. Of course, it doesn't
quite sit the way it used to, and is missing a couple of the lower
screws, but that's to be expected. Here's hoping that I can do
another successful operation without seriously screwing anything
up.
