title: Run An AppleScript From The Command Line
slug: /posts/20eoqjnexz87--run-an-applescript-from-the-command-line
---

Use the `osascript` to run an AppleScript from the command line

For example:

```
osascript hello_world.scpt
```

Which works with a script like this saved from Script Editor

```
return "Hello, World"
```
