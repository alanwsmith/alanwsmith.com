title: 2021 - Next.js Build Notes
---

These notes start from the point when I moved off mdx-bundler

---

Initial setup

```
mkdir alanwsmith.com
cd alanwsmith.com
npx create-next-app .
npm i next-mdx-remote gray-matter
npm i @netlify/plugin-nextjs
```

That got everything ready to go based off the work done on https://next-mdx-remote-blog-example.netlify.app/

---

Moved all components into their own files since next-mdx-remote doesn't work with them inside of files.
