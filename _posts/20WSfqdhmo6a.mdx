Was browsing thru the public library when I got a call about an
error on the site. Cool thing is the library has open wireless. So,
I just pulled out the laptop and jumped on. I was a little worried
that I wouldn't be able to get all the way into the stuff that I
need at the office, but the VPN (Virtual Private Network) worked
like a champ. Sometimes open wireless won't let you use a VPN, but
it wasn't a problem. It's actually wild to think that you could
completely run an online business these days without having your
own internet connection. In fact, if you were willing to use the
library computers, you wouldn't even have to have your own. Just
pay $10/month for a web account. (Of course, you could probably
even set one up for free somewhere, but you get the idea.)
