title: Cant Fix Cell Without a Landline
---

I haven't had a land line phone for a few years now. Just my cell.
The only people who ever called my landline were telemarketers and
I didn't like the idea of paying from them to be able to leave
messages. Recently, the signal I get in my house has been horrible.
I have to stand in the one place in the middle of my living room
most of the time. So, I called Cingular to see if they could figure
out what is up and they say that I have to call them back on a land
line in order to be able to trouble shoot. That's just poor. The
marketers would like you to believe that their phone is the answer
to all your problems. Turns out that isn't the case when there
actually is a problem. Sad.
