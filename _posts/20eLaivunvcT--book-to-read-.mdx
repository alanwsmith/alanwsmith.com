[this review](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/12/13/forever_war_with_bet.html)
on Boing Boing. Adding John Scalzi's "Old Man's War" to the list of
books to read. Also, starting a new Category with this post
uncreatively named "Books" so I have a place to post books I want
to read. Otherwise, I'll never rember them. Suggestions always
welcome.
