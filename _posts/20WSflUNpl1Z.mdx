So, I finally got a little down time with this past Monday and
Tuesday off. Of course, the only reason that happened was because I
was sick. Jackass in the office last week was obviously sick but
came in every day. So, starting Sat. it caught up with me. Lost the
whole weekend and Monday and Tues. Jackass. Found out Wed. when I
came back that three other people in the office got the bug as
well. Jackass.
