This is how to send an alert in an app: 

```osascript
osascript -e 'tell application (path to frontmost application as text) to display dialog "Beware Zombies Ahead"'
```

And this removes the cancel button (leaving only OK) and puts an icon on:

```osascript
osascript -e 'tell application (path to frontmost application as text) to display dialog "Beware Zombies Ahead" buttons {"OK"} with icon stop'
```

Using this because apps may have Notification Center turned off. It seems these dialogs come through regardless

You can also do this which doesn't use a specific app. I think it should pop up on whatever monitor is active

osascript -e 'tell app "System Events" to display dialog "Howdy Doo"'





---

NOTE: There is also this for system events:

```osascript
osascript -e 'tell app "System Events" to display dialog "Howdy Doo"'
```

For notification center alerts


To setup for a notification, make sure that under System Preferences -> Notification -> Script Editor is set to "Allow Notification", then you can run them with:

osascript -e 'display notification "Basic Text Here" with title "Title Text Here"'


---

There is also this, but note that it may not show up on the monitor you're expecting. 


  2                 response = subprocess.run([
  1                     'osascript', '-e',
489                     'display alert "Channel Update" message "{}"'.format(
  1                         json_data['event']['title']
  2                     )
  3                 ])

Or:

-- NOTE These don't necessarily bring the finder to the front
osascript -e 'tell app "Finder" to display dialog "Beware zombies ahead"'

Here's another example:

osascript -e $'tell app "Finder"\rdisplay dialog "Hello, world!"\rend'
