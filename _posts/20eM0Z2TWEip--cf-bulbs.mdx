My local Home Depot currently has a sale running on Compact
Fluorescent bulbs. Six for $10. I've been wanting to get some CF
bulbs to try out. I had one when they first came out, but it
flickered a little and the color was not very pleasing. That was
probably eight or nine years ago. They have come a long way since
then. The ones I got were marked to indicate that they had a color
range similar to a traditional incandescent bulb and this seems to
be pretty much the case. It's a little different, but not at all
unpleasant. As far as I can tell, they have no discernible flicker
and turn on effectively instantly without any perceived warm up
being necessary. One drawback is that the ones I got don't work on
dimmers which is unfortunate as I've switched most of my overhead
lights to be on dimmer switches. But for the floor lamps and the
standard switches are all going to get the CF bulbs. If you are not
familiar with them, they fit in the same socket as regular bulbs
but use something like 1/3 as much energy and should last about 10
times as long. You can read a little about them
[here](http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=cfls.pr_cfls). At some
point, I'll get some daylight balanced ones too for my office. A
lot of photo office have daylight balanced bulbs for looking at
prints. With CF bulbs, you can have that in your house now too. Oh
yeah, and they don't get nearly as hot. So, if you are reading in
bed and reach to put out the light and accidentally hit the bulb
you won't burn yourself nearly as bad. (It'll still hurt and if you
leave your skin on the bulb, it'll get ya, but it's not AS bad.)
