Had an odd thing happen yesterday. My eye was itching a little so I
put some drops in, but it didn't get better. Looking in the mirror
I discovered what looked like a fleck of something on my eye, just
a little off center. More drops to try to flush it out, but it
didn't move at all. In the past, I probably would have just rubbed
my eye some to try to get it to go away, but after having Lasik,
I'm even more paranoid than I used to be about my eyes. So, jumped
in the car for a quick trip to the eye doctor. Looking with their
magnifier they confirmed that whatever it was, it was actually
stuck in my eye a little. That was a little disconcerting, but even
more so was the fact that she used a metal hook similar to the one
a dentist cleans your teeth with to remove the speck. All's, well
now, but I was a little nervous there for a bit.
