Several years ago I discovered a company called
[Mixonic](http://www.mixonic.com/) that provides CD and DVD
services. They do one off and short run disk duplication and
printing. You can get a single CD with full color printing on it
for about $5. I'm sure there are other companies out there now that
do this type of stuff, but when I first discovered them, they were
the only ones I could find. I still haven't used them, but I love
the idea. Would be great for portfolios or, if you are a wedding
photographer, providing a professionally created and printed disk
and case to your brides. It looks like they still offer a
fulfillment services as well. So, if you have a disk you would like
to try to sell, they actually take care of the delivery end as
well. Not clear from a quick glance at their site if they still
offer a store/shopping cart but they used to. Some day, I'll
actually give them a try. If you beat me to it let me know how they
do.
