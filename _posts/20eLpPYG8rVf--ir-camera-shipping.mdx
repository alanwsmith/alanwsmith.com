Just an update for those following the progress. I've gotten a note
saying that my camera has arrived in Washington, has been converted
and is on its way back. Estimated Delivery Day according to UPS is
Tuesday, Aug. 1. I didn't like the fact that August was so close
since time seems to keep flying by, but now I'm REALLY looking
forward to it getting here.
