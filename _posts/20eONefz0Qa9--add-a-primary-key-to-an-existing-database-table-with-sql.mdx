title: Add A Primary Key To An Existing Database Table With SQL
---

Do this to add a primary key to an existing database table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY (column_name)
```

You can make the primary key with multiple columns as well

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY (column_name_1, column_name_2)
```
