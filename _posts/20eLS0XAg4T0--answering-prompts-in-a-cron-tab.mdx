title: Answering prompts in a cron tab
---

Most commands that you are likely to run from cron should have some
type of flag that can be passed to them so they run with requiring
any interaction. Occasionally, you run into a piece of software
that doesn't have a "silent" option. For example, if you have a
cron setup to run: /bin/runthis and there is no flag you can pass
to prevent it from asking: Are you sure (y/n)? the app won't work
as a cron tab on its own. One solution is to pipe the "yes" command
with the app like so: yes | /bin/runthis The yes command will
answer with the "y" for you. "yes" just keeps feeding "y"s until it
exits. If you need you can even pass it another string. For
example, "yes working" will pass "working" until it exits.
