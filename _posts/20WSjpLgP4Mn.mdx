title: Activate a pyenv Virtual Environment
type: snippet
---

I stopped using the code to automatically turn pyenv environments on and off because it was slowing down my shell. Instead, I'm doing it manually with:

```command
pyenv activate VENV_NAME
```

    
Then, close it out with

```command
pyenv deactivate
```
