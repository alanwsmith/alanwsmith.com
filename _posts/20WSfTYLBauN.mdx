I was screwing around with my computer and deleted a peice of
software that I needed to make my wireless internet connection
work. Silly mistake, normally I don't uninstall anything because it
always seems to lead to problems, but I thought it was messing with
something else..... Anyway, I needed to reinstall it, but
discovered that I can't find the CD. I've been straightening up and
after organizing a bunch of stuff I can't find anything. Anyway, I
searched for the part number in google and got to the
manufacturer's web site where I could download the software. I had
two options. The original version and version 4. The card itself
didn't have any version listed so I tried version 1. No go. Then
version 4. No go. After doing some looking around on other sites I
saw people mention version 2 of the software. I went back to the
equipment web site and walked thru it a different way and discover
that both version 2 and 3 exist. I try v2 first, but no luck.
Finally, I get to version 3 and at last the wireless connection
comes back to life. Through a combination of bad (meaning no)
version labeling on the physical part and a deceptive web page
(only listing two of the possible four versions) I spent probably
an hour and a half trouble trying to figure out what was going on
and swaping software on and off my machine. This is a prime example
of one of the things that the overall Computer Industry needs to
start getting right. I'm fairly savy when it comes to computer
stuff and it still took me what seemed like forever. Most people I
know would have given up long before, and the problem wasn't with a
bug in the software, it was just labeling.
