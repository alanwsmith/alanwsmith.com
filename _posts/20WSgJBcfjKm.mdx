When I went to Tuscaloosa back in October for the wonderful Bama v
Tennessee game I had the opportunity to shoot an AR-15. Here's a
photo CJ took of me with it.

This is basically the same thing that our Army uses. It's a little
bewildering to fire it. Like all firearms, it's a controlled
explosion that's taking place in your hands. You see it all the
time on TV and in the movies, but actually firing one is an
entirely different experience. One of the most shocking things to
me was how loud the gun actually is. The volume is one thing
hollywood doesn't even come close to representing. I would imagine
that after one of our soldiers goes through a battle with one of
these that their ears ring for days unless they had a chance to put
in some ear plugs. I doubt that when shooting starts, anyone who
isn't already wearing ear plugs would take the time to stop and put
them in.
