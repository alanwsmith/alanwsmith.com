Took me a while to find this one

let g:prettier#quickfix_enabled=0


trying to use that in `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` so the window doesn't keep popping up with a window that has a prettier error message and then ends with:

```
[Quickfix List] :setqflist()
Prettier: failed to parse buffer
```

with the flag set, you'll still get the `Prettier: failed to parse buffer` message, but it shows up on the line where you enter commands and doesn't block or force you to close the window.
