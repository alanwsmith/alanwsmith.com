I just discovered that the free [IrfanView](http://www.irfanview.com/) image software can make favicon.ico files. These are the little icons often show up that show up on web sites in the address bar or when you bookmark them. [Earlier](/favorite-icons), I had pointed to an online tool that does this, but I prefer local software for this type of thing so this is a very nice discovery.
