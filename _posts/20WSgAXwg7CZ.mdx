The one credit card I have has a feature where you can turn on
various email and/or phone text alerts. The options include the
ability to get your daily, weekly or monthly balance. My question
is why don't they set one up that will shoot a text message to your
phone every time there is a charge to the card. It would be a great
way to help fight fraud. If your sitting at work and some random
charge comes thru, you would know to call the credit card company
immediately and let them know that it wasn't you. Depending on the
speed of the charge, it would be really easy to immediately call
the store where the charge was made and see if the person is still
in the store. While this is unlikely, it would happen from time to
time. It would make it really easy to pull security tapes from just
a few min before and find the person as well. Of course, they don't
offer this service, just a daily account balance.
