A few weeks ago I saw the 30 second teaser trailer for
"[Taken](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0936501/)". All I really got
out of it was:
-   Liam Neeson plays a dad who is some kind of former Secret Agent
    or Mr. Wolf.
-   His daughter get kidnapped by some bad guys
-   Liam is a stone cold badass and is gonna get medieval all over
    the kidnapper's asses.

That was it, but it was enough. My interest was piqued. I was ready
to spend $10 to see the film in the theater instead of waiting for
it to come to NetFlix. Good job marketing team. At least until
yesterday, when I caught one of the other "full" trailers. Now,
don't get me wrong. The movie still looked like something I'd like
to see. The problem is I'm pretty sure I've now seen the entire
movie. Or, at least all the key scenes and good parts. Now I
definitely won't be seeing it in the theater. The studio spent
extra money to turn me off from their film. This is nothing new. As
the studios spend increasing amounts of money creating films,
pressure to make sure they are hits grows. The marketing guys get
the call and put more and more scenes out to try to grow interest
to get more butts in seats. I expect that they have run the numbers
and their math points to this strategy working. With my focus group
of one, I can tell you that it backfires way more often than not.

Another side to this that I wonder about is how directors feel
about so much of their films being broadcast before the are even
released. If I were in their shoes it would piss me off. After
spending a huge amount of time and energy to create a piece of art,
I can't imagine any other possible reaction when you see some of
the best parts being ripped out, slapped back together in a 3
minute montage and shown completely outside of their original
context. Adding insult to injury, there are generally enough visual
queues in the trailer so that when watching the film, you know
exactly when you about to see the clip from the trailer. Instead of
an audience reaction of: "Holy Shit! Did you SEE THAT!" You get:
"Oh yeah, this is that cool part from the trailer I've seen thirty
times. I wonder where I put my Twizzlers"

I would love to see movie marketing that only did a teaser trailer
and then built the rest of the hype without showing any additional
scenes. It seems like it would be fairly easy to shoot extra
footage during principal filming that is specifically for
commercials and marketing. You then get the best of both worlds.
More insight into the story without spoiling of the actual film
itself. For action films in particular, word of mouth marketing
would become much more powerful. Instead of, "Oh, man! There was
this awesome scene where he jumped on a helicopter! Here, check it
out from the trailer." The last sentence would become "You HAVE to
go see it!" Since I don't expect this change, I'll just do my best
to avoid trailers for movies I really want to see. (If you have
tried this yourself, you know it's much harder than it sounds.)
