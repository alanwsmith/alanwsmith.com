title: How To Setup A Command To Open Sublime Text From The Terminal On A Mac

I setup my Mac (running macOS 12.x) to launch Sublime Text from the command line by making a symbolic link like this:

```bash
ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" "/usr/local/bin/st"
```

That lets me type `st` to open Sublime Text. I can also do `st file.txt` or `st file1.txt file2.txt` to open files. 

The approach from the [official documentation](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/command_line.html) is to update the PATH that gets used to look for command line tools to point to the `/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin` directory. That sets up to use the binary named `subl`. 

The reason I use the symbolic links is so I can use the command `st` instead of `subl` since it's shorter and easier to type.
