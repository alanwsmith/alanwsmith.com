Inspiration for blog posts can strike at any time. The fact that
blogs are by definition on the web, this can make it difficult to
post if you aren't online. In the past, I've written a few posts in
a text editor and then copied them over to WordPress later, but
that process is a pain.

After doing a little looking for an offline blog editor, I saw
several references to folks using
[Windows Live Writer](http://get.live.com/writer/overview) and
being quite happy with it. Originally designed to work with
"Windows Live", which I don't use, the Writer component works with
other blogging platforms as well. This includes WordPress, which is
what I use on my site.

So, I'm trying it out now (literally making this post in it). At
first blush, it seems pretty nice. Aside from being able to write
posts when not directly connected to the blog, I also like not
having to work inside the browser itself. While the editor on the
WordPress page is pretty nice and Firefox adds spell checking in
the form, it's still not a very elegant experience to work inside
the browser.

One of my biggest annoyances is that you have to scroll down in the
browser to see the categories. The desktop app nature of the Writer
application allows those categories to always be visible in
selection menu at the bottom of the application. I often forget to
add categories because they aren't in view. Not an issue with the
desktop Writer. Also, there is an option in it's preference to
trigger a reminder to add categories before you post if you didn't
include any. Very nice.

Now, most of these User Interface issues could be solved in the
browser, but overall, it's MUCH easier to tackle that stuff inside
a desktop application.

I did have one issue when trying to install the software. I keep
Firefox set as my default browser. After trying to unsuccessfully
to install the Windows Live Writer a few times I temporarily set
I.E. to be the default browser. After that, the install worked as
expected. So, if you want to try it out, keep that in mind.

There are several other tools built into Writer that I haven't
tried out yet, but the top level it seems to do what I want quickly
and easily and basically get out of my way and let me create posts.
That's the sign of good design. When it does what you want it to do
without really having to think about it.
