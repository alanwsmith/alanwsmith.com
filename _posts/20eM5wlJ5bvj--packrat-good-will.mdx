title: Packrat Good Will
---

I'm a packrat. There are no two ways about it. Two thoughts enter
my mind to varying degrees whenever I think about throwing just
about anything away: 1) Wow! That's a really useful item. Even
though I don't need it right now, I'm sure it'll come in handy some
day, 2) Okay, I really won't need that for a long time, if ever, so
I should get rid of it, but I don't want to throw it away because
it's still perfectly functional. I can fight through the first one
a fair portion of the time, but the desire to be at least a little
environmental makes it tough for me to get over trashing something
that still have plenty of life left in it. Enter
[Good Will](http://www.goodwill.org/). I've known about them
forever and have taken things to them once or twice before, but
I've been doing a pretty major purge of stuff over the past couple
weeks. It's very liberating and you get a nice feeling about
putting useful stuff back out into the world instead of moving it
to a landfill. I'm sure I'll be some level of packrat forever, but
at least for some things, Good Will lets me reduce the tendency.
