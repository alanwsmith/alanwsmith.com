title: Trying new Open Source Software - RSSOwl and MusikCube
slug: /posts/20elwzefzsub--trying-new-open-source-software--rssowl-and-musikcube

I'm trying out two new peices of software that I read about on
[this blog posting](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2006/12/01/30-essential-pieces-of-free-and-open-software-for-windows/).
The are [RSSOwl](http://www.rssowl.org/) and
[musikCube](http://www.musikcube.com/). RSSOwl is a java based RSS
reader and MusikCube is an MP3 player. So far, I like them both. I
think I like the setup of RSSOwl better than RSS Bandit which is
what I had been using. As for musikCube, the biggest thing I like
about it is that the system tray has player controls like "next"
and "previous" available directly. Winamp, which is what I had been
using keeps these under a secondary menu in the system tray which
is a pain to get to. As with a lot of other software that I use,
I'm a big fan of the fact that these are open source.
