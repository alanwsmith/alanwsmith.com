Looking forward to seeing this one:
[speedandangels.com](http://www.speedandangels.com/). It looks like
Top Gun (which gets referenced a few times in the clips.) Except
that it's a documentary. One of the clips in the previews has a
recording of a pilots first launch off an aircraft carrier. Sounds
exactly like what I think would be going thru my head, but I'd
probably be too freaked to get the signal to my brain.
