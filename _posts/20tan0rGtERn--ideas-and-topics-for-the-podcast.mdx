0, Making Is invigorating
1, Music that saved my life - the radio station commercial that got you.
1, Talk about editing - how I was thinking I wouldn't edit, and when I watched some I was fine with that, but when I just listened to it it changed my mind
0, Sane Defaults - why doesn't the 'wrinkle control' default to on? Probalby an energy saving thing, but for the few seconds it runs every 10 minutes it would be better to have it on by default.
0, Making notes of topics - not something I did before - feels a little like cheating somehow, but it's really just the evolution of the thing
2, Moving to 4K even though that doesn't matter now. (not doing video so this isn't a thing any more)
0, The coffee maker at the office where one button you have to hold and the other you have to press stop. 
0, My notecards and collecting notes
0, Not having ideas like I used to (in the before days, I could have ripped off twenty things here in no time, but I'm not coming up with much right now.. though, it is late...)
0, Our identity as we get older and even now. What "are we" - https://twitter.com/THEANTHEMGIRL/status/1459415749378953218

0, Vanity Metrics - vs. dollars. Since I'm not after dollars, they are all vanity and that's fine (even though I'm not really tracking them at the moment. I go for months at a time without looking at my analytics)
0, Usability like gmail where when you mouse over the inbox it raises the chat window so it's under your cursor
0, Talk about the idea of a covers streaming service that gets blanket mechanical licenses
