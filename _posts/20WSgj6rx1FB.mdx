For the past few years [SXSW](http://sxsw.com/) has been releasing
music samplers with a ton of free MP3s from artists who are going
to preform at the festival. I've found a lot of music that I like
sifting through the sampler and am going to start posting some of
it here. I wanted to find a site that already had the audio clips
and would let me embed them in my site. The first site I looked at
was [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/home). I've used them a few times
in the past to stream music and thought I remembered seeing a way
to pull out their player and put it on other sites. When I looked
again, all I could see was a way to embed it on facebook, myspace
and digg. There was no code you could simply grab and embed on a
personal site. Strike One. This struck me as weird so I did a quick
search and found some pages that suggested that you had to create
an account before you could get code to embed. Strike Two. Don't
make me sign up to really get benefit out of your site. I was in
the mood to see how it worked anyway so I created an account and
added the song I wanted to the Library, hit the "Play your Library"
button and got this:

What? I have to add 15 artists before I can hear any of the songs I
want. Strike Three and by the way, to hell with your site. I'm
gone.

Next stop: [imeem.com](http://www.imeem.com/). First thing I see is
a nice search box right in front of me on the home page. I put in
the artist I want to hear, and see a list of songs from that
artist. Click on the one I want to hear and a nice little player
pops up and starts the song for me. Check out the bottom of the
player and the code for me to embed the song is sitting right
there. Sold. The worst part for last.fm is that they actually had a
song that I wanted to include that imeem didn't already have in
their list. So, they would have won even if I had to jump through
some hoops. Seems like a huge miss out of them.
