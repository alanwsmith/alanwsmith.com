Oct. 27, 2020

Writing the date helps. 

It gives me a better sense of the days passing. 

So does taking a couple days off. A two day weekend simply isn't enough. Working remote makes two day weekends not as bad, but it's still not enough. 

Of course, I spent the two days off (and most of the weekend before) working. But, working on my stuff. And, doing it the way I wanted. Steaming in my case. That continues to be a super power. Sometimes I get distracted by chat, but I'm getting better at that. Basically, I see a chat message come up out of the corner of my eye but stay focused on whatever I'm doing until I hit a stopping point. That's the way to do it. Otherwise, it's a constant break in thinking. Even though it's an instant message format, I treat it like email where I only look at it occasionally. 

I did two streams yesterday. The first one was working on my Keyboard Maestro script that I use to prep everything for the stream. I set it up to close app windows for me too. That way I don't have a bunch of Sublime Text windows for various projects open when I start the stream. It took a while to figure out the approach. I ended up using Keyboard Maestro's ability to control application menus directly. When I first thought about that feature it felt fraught. That doesn't really make a lot of sense. The menus are the way most people work with apps most of the time. 

I've got a few more things to see if I can do with it, but it's a great time saver. I learned a ton about the app. The comparison I keep making is to PhotoShop. When you first open the app, it doesn't look like it does much. But, everything is infinitely deep. It's also designed by someone who things like me. There's been a dozen times where I wondered if it did something, just clicked where I thought whatever it was might be, and sure enough it worked. 

The second stream I made progress with the YouTube API for my sync project. I'm not going to say too much about that other than I'm excited about the progress.
