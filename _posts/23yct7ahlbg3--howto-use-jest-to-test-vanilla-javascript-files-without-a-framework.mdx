## The Issue

I'm building a plain old html and vanilla javascript site. I decided I wanted to setup a test suite and picked [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) since it was the first search result. The Jest page says "It works with projects using: Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue, and more!" It took a little hunting to figure out how to run it without using any of those frameworks. Here's what I ended up with. It provides `jest` on the command line for vanilla javascript testing.

## The Process

1. Install jest globally

```bash    
npm install -g jest
```

2. Create a jest.config.js file in your working directory with:

```javascript
const config = {
  verbose: true,
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
}

module.exports = config
```

3. Create a `tests` directory in your working directory

```bash
mkdir tests
```


4. Create a test file in your `tests` directory (e.g. `tests/functions.test.js`)

```javascript
const functions = require('../functions')

test('addition works', () => {
  expect(functions.sum(1, 2)).toBe(3)
})
```

4. Create the file to be tested in your working directory (e.g. `functions.js`)

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
    return a + b
}

module.exports.sum = sum
```

5. Run jest from the command line with:

```bash
jest --watch
```

When you fire that off, you'll get the output from jest that looks something like this: 

```bash
 PASS  ./functions.test.js
  âœ“ addition works (2 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        0.593 s
Ran all test suites.
```

The process stays open and runs tests as you make changes. Press `q` to exit it. 


## The Notes

- You only need to do the first step (where you install jest globally) once
- The `jest` command hangs if you try to run it without a configuration (e.g. `jest.config.js`) file
- Jest uses a Node environment by default. The `testEnvironment: 'jsdom'` line in the `jest.config.js` file switches to JSDOM which allows you to use things like `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {}`
- More details on the configuration options [are here](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration)
- Use `jest` instead of `jest --watch` to do a single run instead of watching files
- The [examples on the jest site](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) only export one function per file. With the code above, you can test multiple functions in a single file (e.g. you could add a function called `minus`, export it with `module.exports.minus = minus`, and test it with `expect(functions.minus(2, 1)).toBe(1)`)
