title: Bug on my windshield
---

To continue with the bug postings, I'm going to move over to an
actual insect. While driving this weekend I hit a bug going about
45MPH. Aparrently he has bug armor because he wasn't the smear that
you would expect, but was still well formed and just hanging on the
window. I pulled over and without the wind in his face he walked
around a little on the glass before flying off. I don't know if I
should be really impressed of scared. Seems like it might be the
start of a bug army that is doing some crash testing to check out
their battle technology before they start the invasion. I managed
to get a shot of him before he took off. It's a little washed out
since the flash went off. He was a darker in color than the photo
makes him out to be.
