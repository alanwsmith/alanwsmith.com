title: Show Postgres Tables
---

this works from the command line:

```
psql -d database_name -U role_name -c "\dn"
```

I'm setup with a local database and postgres role that match my computer login name, so I can just do:

```
psql -c "\dn"
```


To see a list of tables in a schema via SQL use:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'the_schema_name';
```

If you need a list of the schemas to know which one to pick, use:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_namespace;
```
