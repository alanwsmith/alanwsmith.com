[This graphic](http://www.deviantart.com/view/9410862/) is an
eye-opening display of where our tax dollars end up getting spent.
Very well done and worth a look. Most of the time when I hear
numbers about spending they are so big that they are hard to
comprehend and rarely are they presented in a way I can do a
comparison. This graphic makes it easy.
