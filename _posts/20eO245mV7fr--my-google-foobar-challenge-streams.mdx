title: My Google FooBar Challenge Streams

Google has a code challenge they throw in front of developers from time to time. It starts when you do a search and the results tip back to reveal the challenge. I got it once before but was messing around and closed it. It showed up a second time and I managed to keep it open. 

Figured it would be fun to figure the answers out on stream. Right now, I've completed the first two levels and am working on the third. 

(And, yea. All this stuff is answered online, but coping down pretty much defeats the purpose of seeing if I can do it myself.)

### Level 1 - Solution 1 (Part 1)

Figuring out how to do the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) with a dynamic ending number.

### Level 1 - Solution 1 (Part 2)

Finishing up my first take on the solution for building a string from prime numbers.

### Level 1 - Solution 1 (Part 3)

Trying another method for the solution to level 1. Wasn't digging the original method and came up with this one that I like better.

### Level 2 - Solution 1

Next one up. Did this one all in one go. Another fun one to solve the pattern.
