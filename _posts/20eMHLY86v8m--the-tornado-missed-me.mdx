I was in ATL again this week. Spent a few days this go round
including Friday night when a tornado hit downtown including the
Georgia Dome where Bama was playing basketball. I was watching the
game in the hotel bar about 2.5 miles away. Looking outside the
weather was obviously severe, but I didn't realize it was a tornado
till later.
