There's an overwhelming number of tech videos out there. When I'm eating lunch, I'd like to watch some, but picking the one to watch takes more mental energy than I have when I'm hungry. 

So, here's the idea. A site that has an invisible playlist and just autostarts something from it at random. 

I you don't like it, you can jump to the next one. It's like flipping through channels where you don't know what you'll see so you don't have to think about it in advance. 

The other aspect will be a "how much time do you have" feature. Where you can click to let the site know if you have 30, 45, 60 minutes. 

That would be the only filter on it.
