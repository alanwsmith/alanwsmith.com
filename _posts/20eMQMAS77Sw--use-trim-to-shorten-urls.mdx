There are a few tools out there that let you take a long URL and
turn it into a short one. One that I've used in the past is
[tinyurl.com](http://tinyurl.com/), but I've recently found another
service at [http://tr.im/](http://tr.im/). For a shortening
service, that's about as short a name as you can get. Bonus for the
fact that it makes sense and applies to what they do. To use tr.im,
all you have to do is copy a long URL from the address bar, paste
it into the box on their [home page](http://tr.im/) and hit the
"tr.im!" button. They'll take your long URL like:


and turn it into something like this:
[http://tr.im/71mv](http://tr.im/71mv). The trimmed URL is much
easier to deal with in email messages and status updates.

The tr.im service provides an additional tracking services as well.
Each time someone uses one of your trimmed URLs, the browser will
bounce through their server momentarily while it figures out where
to send them for the final page. The tr.im server uses this to
capture stats on how your shortened URL is used. Going to back to
tr.im on the same browser that you used to create the shortened
URLs will show you the stats. If you create an account, you can log
in and see these stats from any browser (and you won't loose the
information if you clear the cookies on your machine).

There are a few concerns with the service. For one, you have to
make sure you are okay with the fact that you are sending traffic
through their servers. This shouldn't be an issue for anything
that's not sensitive information, but it's something to think
about. The other thing to think about is permanence. I'm not sure
how tr.im makes money, but it surely costs them something to host
the service. If you post all your links through them, but their
company goes away, those links would stop working. Not a big deal
in cases for things like old status messages that you'll probably
never look at again. It is also possible at some point that they
change the way their service works. For example, instead of
immediately jumping to the destination URL, they could easily put
an ad in between, or even launch a pop-up that you have no control
over. It seems unlikely that they would be that aggressive, but as
with any free service like this, it is worth keeping in mind that
they can change the way things work at any time.
