Took a plane right out to Austin Texas yesterday. As I have done
ever since I got a portable music player I charged up the batter
and got it ready to go. The only problem is that when I was syncing
the music only one playlist got moved over. It was "Like Green Day"
from the Yahoo music service. This is supposed to be a bunch of
band that play in the same vein as Green Day. The problem is that
basically everything on the list sucked. All it really turned out
to be is cheap imitations of Green Day. Bands that seem to exist
for the soul purpose of creating an overly produced sound that is
similar to them in order to try to pull in some dollars. Really not
good at all.  
Cookie cutter music pisses me off. It was all so sterile it felt
like muzak. The moral of the story is to make sure you have a good
set of music with you before you leave.
