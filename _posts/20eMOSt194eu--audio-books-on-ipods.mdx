If you have CD audio books that you want to convert over to play on
your iPod,
[this page](http://www.dagondesign.com/articles/turning-mp3-audiobooks-into-ipod-audiobooks/)
has instructions for doing just that. I haven't tried it yet, but
want to make sure I've got the link ready to go when I do. In the
past, I have just made MP3s and done a play list. This is fine as
long as you listen straight through, but if you stop and listen to
something else, you loose your place and have to find it again
which can be really tricky. When the files are identified as being
part of an audiobook, they are speced to maintain internal
bookmarks. So, even if you leave it and listen to something else,
when you come back, it'll pick up where you left off.
[Here's a page](http://oakroadsystems.com/genl/itunsabk.htm) that
has notes on importing directly from a CD instead of from existing
MP3s.
