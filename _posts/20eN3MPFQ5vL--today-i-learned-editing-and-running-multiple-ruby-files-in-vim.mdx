title: Today I Learned Editing and Running Multiple Ruby Files in Vim
---

Here's a quick way to open several 

1. Open the executable and all the supporting lib files in tabs in Vim, and
2. Set a hotkey to run the gem from any of the tabs.

For example, take a gem in:

    /Users/you/working/sample_gem

with a basic structure of:

    |-- bin
    |   `-- sample_gem
    `-- lib
        |-- sample_gem
        |   |-- bar.rb
        |   |-- baz.rb
        |   |-- biz.rb
        |   |-- foo.rb
        |   `-- version.rb
        `-- sample_gem.rb
