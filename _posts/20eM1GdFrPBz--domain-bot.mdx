If you are ever looking to setup a web site and are trying to
decide on a name, this site might help: http://www.domainsbot.com/
You put in some words or terms and hit search and it gives you a
list of recommendations and shows you if they are available or not.
While it's fairly easy to check on specific domains, it can get
time consuming quickly. This little bot can at least help get you
started.
