I just heard an Otis Taylor track that I didn't know I had. I think
it came from a SXSW music sampler, but I'm not sure. The track is
"Please Come Home Before It Rains". It's awesome. You can check out
a sample from amazon
[here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/music/wma-pop-up/B0001XAJTI001001/ref=mu_sam_wma_001_001/002-7137960-9375224).
It's been a while since I've really had a chance to explore new
music. Or, more to the point, since I have taken the time to do it.
I'm jones for some new stuff now. Probably will end up signing back
up for that yahoo subscription service. In the mean time, I'm going
to play this track a lot.
