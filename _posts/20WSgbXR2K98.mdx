According to this
[change.gov](http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/new_official_portrait_released/)
page, this is the first time that an official presidential portrait
has been taken with a digital camera. I wonder if any will be done
with film in the future? I'd like to think so, but that will be an
increasingly risky bet. Note: Found this via
[Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/) which also post the
following meta data about the image:
*Canon EOS 5D Mark II, taken 2009:01:13 17:38:39 No flash, 105.0mm focal length, 1/125 exp, f/10.0, ISO100*
Mmmmmm 5D Mark II......
