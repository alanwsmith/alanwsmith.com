I don't think I've posted this one yet, but it follows along the
same lines of
[not putting your beer in the freezer](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/2006/02/21/dont-put-your-beer-in-the-freezer).
That makes things explode because they are too cold. Hot cars in
Florida can have the opposite temperature extreme with the same
outcome. Don't leave unopened cans in the car.

This is actually from last year, but I just ran across it. I
grabbed a Barq's at the store one day and didn't realize that it
was diet till I was well on my way. I figured I'd just toss it in
the fridge at work and someone would drink it. Only, I didn't take
it out of my car. There was surprisingly little liquid, in the can
(or on the floor or the roof). I think a lot of it must have
evaporated almost instantly when it exploded. Wish I had had video
in the car. It's almost worth trying that, but I'm afraid it would
coke the camera before the beverage.
