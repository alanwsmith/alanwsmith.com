- Doesn't look like you can load directly from a JSON like you could in V2. 
- It lists it here as an option, but can't find where to actually do it: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html
- There is a way to load from an external process. 
- That's probably the way to do it. 
- Check this out and figure out a way to set it up: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-configured-credential-process.html

For reference, here's the note from V2 - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-json-file.html
