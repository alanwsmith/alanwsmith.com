I can't trace where this came from in my mind, but I was thinking
an interesting super hero story would be about a hero that has been
around for a while. After a few years of doing his hero thing and
keeping his secret identity actually secret he ends up in some
situation where someone is in danger and the only way that he can
save them is using his powers in plain view and forfeiting his
secret identity. Two obvious plays on this are a story where the
hero chooses to keep his identity safe and sacrifices the person
and then dealing with the internal aftermath in a case where there
would have been no expectation for his hero to show up and save the
day. The other one would be for him to save the person and then
follow the story of him dealing with the aftermath of everyone
knowing who he is. (I'm saying he, but it could, of course, be a
woman.) Anyway, for a story some day.
