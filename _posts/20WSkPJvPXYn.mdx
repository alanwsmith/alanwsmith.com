My leader key doesn't always fire

I thought it might be coc, but I uninstalled it and that doesn't appear to have been the problem

I have the leader mapped to `,`

What happens is that I hit <ESC> and then the leader key and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. 

Based off this page (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14737429/how-to-disable-the-timeout-on-the-vim-leader-key), I tried:

`set ttimeout`

but that didn't work.

Bascially, I have to hit the key twice. this happened even when I set the leaderkey to the default `\`
