The only thing I had to do to embed a tableau dashboard in a NextJS site was to call the iframe and append `:embed=y` to the URL like:

```jsx
<iframe
    width="1366"
    height="758"
    src="https://tableau.example.com/views/SomeThing/SomeThing?:embed=y"
></iframe>
```

There were some other options that shoed up when I sniffed the iframe out from the javascript, they were:

```jsx
:embed=y&amp;:showVizHome=n&amp;:tabs=y&amp;:apiID=host0"
```

I took all of them out except the `embed=y` and the dashboard still worked. As soon as I took embed out, I got errors like:


To protect your security, tableau.acebi.us will not allow Firefox to display the page if another site has embedded it. To see this page, you need to open it in a new window.

And: Blank Screen and Error "Refused to display `<URL of View>` in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'SAMEORIGIN'" When Loading an Embedded View

And

`tableau.example.com refused to connect` in Chrome


The embed also works with my authentication/authorization which was handled by OneLogin (I expect the built in auth would work too)
