How to kill an idea][1] - (by [Scott Campbell][2]) - I saw this on one site and had to do a google image search and then jump through a few other sites before I found the original artist. We should all get better at citing things.

2. [See Something? Cite Something.][3] - Related to the first link. A flowchart about citing the work of others.

3. [Historically Hardcore][4] - How a fake campaign for the Smithsonian took off.

4. [Why nose grease kills the foam in your beer/coke][5] - If you've never seen the trick it's fascinating to watch. Gross, but fascinating.
