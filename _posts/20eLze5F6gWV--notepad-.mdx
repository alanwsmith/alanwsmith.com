Another fine piece of open source (read free) software:
[Notepad ++](http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm) I
found this one via the afore mentioned
[osalt.com](http://www.osalt.com/) while looking for a replacement
for UltraEdit. Both applications are plain text editors. In the
past UltraEdit was the main program that I used to do my
programming. Even though these programs only edit text files, they
do a whole lot for programmers. Things like syntax highlighting and
auto complete make it much easier to deal with the files. Notepad
++ like UltraEdit is windows only. If you are on windows and you
need a good, free text editor, I'd give it a try.
