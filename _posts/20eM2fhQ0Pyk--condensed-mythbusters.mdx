I really get a kick out of the show "Mythbusters" on the Discovery
channel. Problem solving, science, not infrequent explosions and
urban ledgends.... what more could a tech geek ask for. Of course,
it seems to do a great job of reaching a fairly broad audience
which is great as well. Reminds me a lot of Mr. Wizard's World
where just about everyone was entertained by science and everyone
got a little smarter because of it. One major gripe that I have
about the show though is it quickly starts to feel like one of
those "Top 10 Worst Car Crashes Caught On Tape" shows with its
editing. I don't mind a general introduction at the start of the
show that lets you know what's coming up, but before each
commercial break they tease the entire rest of the show. By the
time you get to the last myth they are examining, it feels like you
have heard a "Coming up later" voice over about it a half dozen
times. And then they recap all the stuff you have seen leading up
to it. Some of which you just saw 30 seconds ago. It's huge
overkill. I'm sure that this is largely done so that they can make
sure that each show is an hour, but sadly almost enough enough to
turn me off from the show. While I'm over-exaggerating a little, it
would be interesting to see someone slice up the show in time
blocks and figure out how much is 1) commercials, 2) teasing later
content, 3) reviewing previous content and 4) actual mythbusting
content. My guess is that it varies from show to show and is
largely dependent on the complexity of the setup for the respective
myths, but I'd put the over/under at about 21 min of actual content
in a broadcast hour of the show.
