title: iPhone seems quite nice
---

okay, I wasn't all that hyped about the iPhone. It looked cool, but
none of the ads I was really got my blood up. Today I was out
running around with a buddy and he suggested we stop by the local
apple store to see if they had one to take a look at. They had
about 8 on display (with a huge ass security guard standing about
10 feet away from the table). So, I'm pretty darn impressed. Using
the various functions on the phone was very intuitive and the
screen/display was gorgeous. The overall size was a little smaller
in all three dimensions than I had imagined and by and large that's
a good thing. It didn't feel bulky at all to me. I think this was
mainly a function of how thin the device is. The only drawback I
saw in my few min of fun (aside from the steep ass price for both
hardware and service) was typing. It wasn't bad, especially since
it was my first time trying it, but I missed the key I was aiming
for several times while trying to type "the quick brown fox jumps
over the lazy dog". When I was typing, I was using both thumbs.
After I left, I got to thinking about this, and I'd like to try
again just holding the thing with one hand and typing with just the
index finger of the other. I have a feeling that would be more
accurate. Also, I'm sure it gets a fair amount easier with
practice. Bottom line, I'm very impressed, but it's way too steep a
price point for me until I get sponsored.
