Happy day. I just found: [osalt.com](http://www.osalt.com/) (Open
Source Alternative). It has mappings between open source and
commercial software so you can easily check to see if there is an
open source alternative to an app you use. They seem to keep their
alternative list paired down nicely. This is a great advantage as
there can be a ton of alternatives to some of the more popular
commercial applications. The problem is lots of them are dead
projects that didn't get very far or are so "beta" to not really be
useful at all. With luck, they will just maintain a list of the top
alternatives.
