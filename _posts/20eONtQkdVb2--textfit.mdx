Use this to fit text into an area:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-textfit

Look at this for dynamically setting mutle line vs single line:

```javascript
<Textfit mode={"This is the text to fit".length < 20 ? 'single' : 'multi' }>
This is the text to fit
</Textfit>
```



You can also set `min` and `max` for the font sizes
