I wonder what the defining moments in history will be for future
generations. I'm sure I'lll have as vivid a recolleciton of the
Sept. 11 planes crashing into the World Trade Center towers as my
folks did of the Kennedy assassination. Probalby more so thanks to
the relentless news. I'm almost afraid to think about what the
moments that will burn themselves into the memories of the next and
future generations will be. Mainly, I just hope that my friend at
work is wrong. He thinks he'll live to see an nuclear bomb be used
inside the U.S. Obviously, I really hope he's wrong. Both for the
initial lose of life but also for the destruction that would surely
rain down after. (A darker thought than I normally post, but it's
been on my mind more recently than normal.)
