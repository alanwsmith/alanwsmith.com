I've finally gotten around to building my new "gallery" web page
tool. Of course, since I'm a web geek this actually involved
transfering my site to a new server, building my own personal PHP
framework, setting up a staging server, building a deployer from
the stage to the production site, constructing a script on the
production server to unwrap the content sent over by the deployer,
and, of course, the gallery templates them selves. Could I have
simply downloaded a peice of software to do this for me, or use
photoshop to auto generate them, or just used flickr? Sure, but
none of those are really my style. Why do something that easy when
you can create a ton of work for yourself? Yes. I'm that much of a
geek. All of that is also to say that the galleries themselves are
pretty bare at the moment. Someday I'll jazz them up a little, but
probalby not too much. I'm a big fan of the simple approach to
display. Anyways, here's a few from shoots that I've done out at
Freebird. If you've looked at my stuff before, you've probably seen
these before:

Now that all that is done, one of the next steps is to get my IR
stuff posted. I hope to do that over the long weekend.
