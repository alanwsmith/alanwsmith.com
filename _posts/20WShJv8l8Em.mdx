Normally, I shoot photos on one day and post them on the next. That way, I get to pick from all the possible options. Today, I knew from the moment I woke up what the shot would be. No need to wait. 

Here's the T-minus One Day Elephant from the collection my mom has given me over the years. To say I'm excited about Bama kicking off tomorrow is an understatement.

Roll Tide!
