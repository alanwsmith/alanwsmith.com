And
[here is where you can get](http://2005.sxsw.com/geekout/fest4pod/)
a copy of the showcase (assuming the torrent is still live which I
can't check right now). When I hit the page, it asked me if I
wanted to visit the new version of the site. You don't since the
link to the tracks is on the archive.
