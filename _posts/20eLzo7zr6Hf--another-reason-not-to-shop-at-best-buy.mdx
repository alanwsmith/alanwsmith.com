title: Another reason not to shop at Best Buy
slug: 20eLzo7zr6Hf--another-reason-not-to-shop-at-best-buy

This came out a while ago. But it turns out that Best Buy has two
versions of their website. A public one and one that is only
available in stores. Seems that they advertise prices on their
public website, but they have them at full price on the internal
one.
[Here is a short blurb](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/03/03/best_buy_admits_to_k.html)
on it. I haven't shopped at Best Buy
[in a long time](/why-i-wont-shop-at-best-buy-anymore).
This internal web site is another example of unethical business
practices. I've got no problems with a company going after profits,
but tricking and lying to your customers is out of bounds. Not that
it makes a bit of difference to them, but my commitment to not shop
at their stores has been re-enforced.
