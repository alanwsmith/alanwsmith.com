A long time ago, I saw this video for the song "Sugar Water" by
Cibo Matto.
While trying to see if I could find it online, I was looking for
"Backwards videos" and came across a page that had this one for the
song "Typical" by Mute Math.
I'd never heard of them, but I dig the tune. They have a site
[mutemath.com](http://www.mutemath.com/) if you want to check out
more.
