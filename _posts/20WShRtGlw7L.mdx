title: Nice Code Formatting Conversion On Python Site
type: post
---

The [documentation on the official Python site][1] site has a nice little design feature in its code examples. Each one starts out formatted for Python's "interactive interpreter" and show the expected results. For example, this snippet from the [Output Formatting][2] section:

![Image: aws-20130128--1030-01a.png](/aws-20130128--1030-01a.png)

If you click the little ">>>" symbol in the upper left corner, the code instantly jumps to a format suitable for being run in a file. The expected out also disappears making the snippet ready to copy and paste directly into a file. 

![Image: aws-20130128--1030-02a.png](/aws-20130128--1030-02a.png)

That's an incredibly useful feature. Very nicely done, Python doc crew.
