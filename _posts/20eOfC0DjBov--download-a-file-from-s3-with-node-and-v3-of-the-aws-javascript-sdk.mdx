  I couldn't find good, concise nodes on working with S3 via V3 of the AWS
  JavaScript SDK so I made my own

title: Download A File From S3 With Node And V3 Of The AWS JavaScript SDK
---

- Working on this in `~/workshop/aws_javascript_sdk_scratchpad/s3_download_file.js`



Make a project and install the skd:

```
mkdir some_thing
cd some_thing
npm init -i
# fill stuff out
yarn add @aws-sdk/client-s3
```



echo 'console.log("Hello, World")' > index.js

Notes:

- In boto3 in python, you install a single module and get access to all the services. Here, AWS has setup to split each module to its own thing. 



- Look at this one for a sample for a test file: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/issues/1877 - But thinking why not just always do it the same with binary so you don't have to worry about making a switch
