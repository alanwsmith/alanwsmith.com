Not a big surprise, but you can skip UltraViolet. Or, do some drugs
and watch the first fifteen minutes of action (that is pretty good
and very colorful), then leave. They tried just a little too hard,
and it felt like it was a movie designed by a committie instead of
an artist. Two out of four stars. Of course, Milla Jovovich is very
nice on the eyes.
