Docs are here, under Specifications:

    https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api

There's a feed with a list of the available end points here:

    https://api.weather.gov/openapi.json

Note that not all the endpoints lists in that JSON are considered operational according to the sepcifications

I'm pretty sure when you see `{wfo}` it stands for Weather Forecast Office. which appears to be the same as the gridID

Get coordinates by looking at google maps and pulling the coords (e.g. `40.123,-71.434` ), then do this:

Use the coordinates to get the data with:

    curl -X GET "https://api.weather.gov/points/40.123%2C-71.434" -H "accept: application/geo+json"
    
Not sure you really need the `-H "accept: application/geo+json"`, but it was in the example.

Looks like you can get a current set of data with:

    https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/LWX/96,70
    
You can also get the forecast with:

    https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/LWX/96,70/forecast

use it to get the forecast data.
