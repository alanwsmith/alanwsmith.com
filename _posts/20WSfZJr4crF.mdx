Saw "The Illusionist" this weekend. Very enjoyable film. There was
surprisingly little music in it, but that didn't detract from it.
The movie really was all about the story and didn't try to use
special effects, or try to be overly dramatic. It's one of those
films that you don't have to see in the movie theater to get the
"full experience", but it's probably worth it anyway. At a minimum,
it's worth seeing when it hits DVD.
