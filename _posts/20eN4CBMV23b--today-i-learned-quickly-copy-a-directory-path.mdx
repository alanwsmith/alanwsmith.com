title: Today I Learned Quickly Copy a Directory Path
slug: 20eN4CBMV23b--today-i-learned-quickly-copy-a-directory-path
---

I add this to my `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, etc... files to quickly copy directory paths from the command line:

```bash{numberLines: true}
alias pwc="pwd | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy"
```

It runs `pwd`, clips the newline off then sends it to the pasteboard (aka clipboard). 

Super handy.

_Side note: "pwd" stands for "print working directory". Using "cwd" would make more sense grammatically (i.e. "copy working directory") but the keystrokes are cumbersome. Hence, I use "pwc". Your mileage may vary. Season to taste._
