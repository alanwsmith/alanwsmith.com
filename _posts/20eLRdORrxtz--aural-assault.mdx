The paranoid part of me is kicking in. I think I'm the subject of
some twisted psychology experiment. Last week they kept
[weed eaters and lawn mowers](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/?p=153)
going outside my office all day. Today, it's an air compressor.
Sure, it looks like they are putting new shingles on the building
next door, but I don't buy it for a second. They are just trying to
see how much I can take before I run out the door screaming.
