When I was a kid staying with my Grandparents in Tennessee my
Grandpa and I would go out sometimes and shoot .22 rifles at tin
cans. Also, one time when I was probably eight or ten my uncle let
me shoot a 9mm pistol of his once. Other than that I've never
really done much shooting. I've kinda wanted to do a little pistol
shooting for a while so last weekend I found a local firing range
that lets you rent guns to shoot and gave it a spin. It's a bit
surreal. You walk in, show them your ID, sign a form saying you
aren't high or drunk and they hand you a 9mm
[Glock 17](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLOCK_17) and a box of
ammo. 

Here's a shot of the pistol.

Considering I've never really shot a pistol I think I did okay.
![Target Practice](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/20060923-124436-01.jpg "Target Practice")

There are 40 rounds in the target below. Twenty shots from about 8
yards and twenty shots from 15 years. 

These were the last of the
box of 50 that I shot and my arm was surprisingly tired. I didn't
really think it would be a workout, but it was a bit of one. If you
have never shot a pistol (or I suppose a gun of any sort), it's a
wild experience. You squeeze the trigger slowly and nothing happens
for a while as it's moving back. Then, with a suddeness that is
hard to describe, you are literally holding a controled explosion
in your hand. 

It's over so fast that you don't have time to react
to it till a half second after the bullet has hit the target. It
feels very different than it looks in the movies. 

No. I'm not going
to turn into a "gun nut", but it was a fun experience. A little
pricy though. Gun rental was $15 for two guns (I also shot the
smaller [Glock 26](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLOCK_26)), Range
fee was $10, and the box of 50 shots of ammo was another $10. About
$40 with tax.
