_NOTE This is a work in progress. It's the seed of an idea. We'll see where it goes and how it grows..._

Goal:

Create an open web content pointing to system (can't come up with a better word right now because it's late.)


Basic idea:

- Use pinboard.in as a source of link

- Provide access to recent and popular by default. 

- Let folks search for tags they want to add. 

- Provide a way to remove sites/terms via block lists

- Wire up webmentions to produce a content feed based off upvotes. 

- Add in Sentiment Analysis for the rankings.

- Some pinboard links will be just links and titles, setup a crawler to pull descriptions from the pages. similar to search engine results pages

- Crawl the web to find RSS feeds to pull in. 

- Analyze the pages to provide recommendations based off magic.
