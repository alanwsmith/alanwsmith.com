I'm not that much of a car guy. I love the one I have which is
about 12 years old now and close to turning 200,000 miles. One car
that I would love to have though is the one that was put out a
little while ago is the
[Tesla Roadster](http://www.teslamotors.com/design/gallery-body.php).
Sure, it's an electric car, but it's a bad ass electric car. Kick
around the site if you haven't heard about it before.
