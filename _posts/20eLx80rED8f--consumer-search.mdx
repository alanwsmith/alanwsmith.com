I've been doing a little research on free firewalls and virus
software and came across
[Consumer Search](http://www.consumersearch.com/). They act as a
clearning house and digest service for reviews. You can learn a
little more about them on their
[about us](http://www.consumersearch.com/www/about.html) page. The
best thing is that they aim to keep their reviews fresh. Looks like
a very handy page to have bookmarked.
