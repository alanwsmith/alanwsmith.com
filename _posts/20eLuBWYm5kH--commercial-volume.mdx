I find it super annoying when the volume on a TV commercial is
about 5 times as loud as the show you are watching. I'm fairly
certain this is done on purpose. You have to turn up the volume to
hear the dialog on a show then the commercial screams at you. The
networks have started putting full episodes of some of their shows
online with limited commercials in them that I've been checking
out. Turns out they use this same volume blast tactic online as
well. I applaud the effort to push content online, but am
dissapointed by the fact that they use the same thing.
