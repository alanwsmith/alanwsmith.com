Dec. 24, 2020

I just ordered a couple black polo shirts from Amazon. They are super cheap at $12 per. 

I'm checking the size. Once I know which one fits the best, I'm going to buy a dozen. I'm going to wear them every time I do a video for [ThisIsHowYouProgram.com](http://thisishowyouprogram.com). I'll wear the same glasses too and I'll get my hair cut more often. The idea is to have as little variation as possible in my appearance. 

It's a minor way to reduce distractions from the videos. As much as possible I'll be neutrally buoyant.
