Saw Ironman last weekend. Even at $9.50 FL movie prices, it's worth
seeing on the big screen. Saw a preview for the new Indian Jones
too. Gotta say, the trailer actually made it look pretty good. Of
course, that doesn't mean anything, but I'm at least hopeful. Also
saw a preview for
[The Dark Knight](http://thedarkknight.warnerbros.com/). Totally
looking forward to that one. High probability I'll be seeing that
one opening weekend.
