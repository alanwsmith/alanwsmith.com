I haven't played with it yet, but there is an open source backup
application called
"[PowerFolder](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=119524)"
that looks interesting. It is SoureForge's
[Project of the Month](http://sourceforge.net/community/potm-200806/)
this month. To get that distinction, an application has to be
pretty high quality, so it's certainly worth checking out. I'm
dropping it here so I can find it later. It could be a little
confusing to search for since:
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/powerfolder/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/powerfolder/)
takes you to: PowerFolder is workflow server and development
studio. As opposed to:
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/powerfolder-/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/powerfolder-/)
which is where the backup software is.
