title: Stop, Start, and Restart The Yabai Tiling Window Manager

### Restart

```
brew services stop yabai && brew services start yabai
```

It takes a bit (up to a minute or so) for yabai to stop. Using this command joined with `&&` makes sure that the start command waited for the stop command to finish.

Things jump around a lot when it starts back up. Give it a bit to settle down. Also, windows sometimes end up in different places. Don't be surprised if you have to move stuff around after a restart.


### Just Stop 

```
brew services stop yabai
```

### Just Start

```
brew services start yabai
```
