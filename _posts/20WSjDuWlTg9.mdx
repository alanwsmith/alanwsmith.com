title: Litmus Test Movies ~ Or, How To Know If We're Gonna Be Friends

Saw a great question come across twitter:

@kerrizor - [Do you have films that are litmus tests for you?](https://twitter.com/kerrizor/status/1357404034827644928)

Super fun! I went through my list to pick out a few... Ended up being more than a few. 

So, here's my test. If you don't dig, say, 50% of these that you've seen, I wonder if we'd get along. 

(Caveat: This list is based off when I saw the films. I haven't seen most of in years. Lots probably don't hold up and I'm sure some have become problematic. )

If you passed the test and want to hang out, I'm at [@TheIdOfAlan](https://twitter.com/theidofalan). And, if you have different taste, we should probably still hang out to compare notes.
