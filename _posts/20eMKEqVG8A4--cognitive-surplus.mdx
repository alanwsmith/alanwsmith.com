This
[article](http://www.herecomeseverybody.org/2008/04/looking-for-the-mouse.html)
entitled "Gin, Television, and Social Surplus" has come up a time
in the various sources I visit. While I don't buy into it
completely, it's got more than enough interesting concepts to
warrant a recommendation. Key concepts that caught my eye are the
idea that the entire Wikipedia represents \~100 million hours of
human thought and that we, in the U.S. spend 200 billion hours
watching TV each year. In other words, 2,000 Wikipedia projects a
year spent watching television. I think we'll always tend towards
relaxing entertainment when it's available, but I like it's fun to
think about what we might come up with by using a small portion of
the surplus. Or, more to the point, if somehow we shift towards
"active" entertainment. Check back in five years.
