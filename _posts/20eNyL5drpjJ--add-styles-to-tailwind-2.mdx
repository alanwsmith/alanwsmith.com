title: Add Styles To Tailwind 2
slug: 20eNyL5drpjJ--add-styles-to-tailwind-2
---

NOTE: In order to get this to work, I had to:

```bash
rm package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```



Tailwind removes most default styles via it's `preflight`. Global/base styles can be added back in in the `syltes/global.css` file in Gatsby after walking through the Tailwind install. 

An example:

```css

```
