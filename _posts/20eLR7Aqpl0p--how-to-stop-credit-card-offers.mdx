After I got my house the number of credit card, refinance, home
equity line of credit, etc... went up to between 20-30 a week.
After doing some checking I discovered how to basically put an end
to this. Go to:
[http://www.optoutprescreen.com/](http://www.optoutprescreen.com/)
and walk through the "Opt-out" process. Basically, all those
companies that send you offers have pulled your credit report along
with a batch of other folks to screen for people they want to
extend offers to. When you opt-out, it prevents companies from
doing this without your permission. The net effect is that within a
couple months the majority of that type of junk mail will end.
Better for the environment and a time saver for you. Another
benefit is it reduces the risk of identy theft by someone stealing
your mail. I did this a while ago and it's been oh-so-nice.
