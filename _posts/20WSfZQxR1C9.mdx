If you ever need to make a copy of a web site to keep on your local
machine, you can use [HTTrack](http://www.httrack.com/). It grabs
local copies of the files require to render the site and converts
them so that you can browse the site offline on your computer.
Great for things like documentation sites that you want to be able
to use when you are on your computer but away from an internet
connection.
