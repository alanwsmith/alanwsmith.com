... and the rest of the crew on The Wire. I'm bad about doing the
"What's your favorite Movie/Song/Album/Show" game, but the Wire
would easily be in the top list of shows. If you haven't watched it
go rent the DVDs starting with season 1. It's paced and told
differently and has a more amorphous scope than most shows. So, if
you don't like it at first, give it at least 5-6 episodes before
you bail. A key element that drives my liking of the show is that
there the line between good and bad can get really fuzzy. In the
fifth and last season, there were several times I was worried that
they were taking this a little too far. That they were getting so
far out there, that they wouldn't be able to get back. I'm happy to
report that, for the most part, this wasn't the case. While by no
means at the top, the final episode was pretty high up there on the
awesome scale. There were some thing in the story line that I
didn't like in terms of where they ended up, but they all kept to
the tone of the show. It was more about the characters and feeling
like you wished that things turned out better for them. So, empathy
for the characters inside the story and not feeling short changed
by the creators of the story. That's a tough thing to pull off. I
didn't notice the title of the episode till I was looking up the
spelling of a name on the HBO web site. The last one was called
"â€”30â€”" which is a great node to the newspaper industry (which
the last season has a heavy focu on) where articles and press
releases often end with that string. Here's a fun little page about
ending with that. Apparently no one is sure where the origin is,
but the one I heard was alway to signify the end of a story over a
transmission. In that light, it's a perfect title for a damn fine
ending.

P.S. one thing that I really didn't like about the last season was
the episode count.
-   Season 1 - 13 Episodes
-   Season 2 - 12 Episodes
-   Season 3 - 12 Episodes
-   Season 4 - 13 Episodes
-   Season 5 - 10 Episodes

Not cool with the shorter. Might have been the writer's strike, but
I don't care. I want those 2-3 episodes back.
