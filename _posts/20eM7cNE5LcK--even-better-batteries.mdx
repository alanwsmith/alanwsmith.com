From an environmental perspective, I love rechargeable batteries.
Not throwing old used batteries in a land file is very nice thing.
Also, when I some day put solar panels on my roof, there won't even
be a carbon cost on the back end to get them juiced up. And, of
course, there is the financial aspect that once you pay much less
for a set of rechargeables and the electricity for a decent number
of charges than you would for a comparable number of one time sets.
The one gotcha that the rechargeables I own have is that they don't
really hold a charge. The main thing I use the batteries for is to
power my small on and off camera flashes. When they are fully
charged up, the NiMH batteries do a great job of this. The problem
is that I don't shoot that often and with the battery leak, I
pretty much have to plan a day in advance if I want to be able to
use them. Otherwise, the last charge that I have given them is
likely to be a few weeks in the past and the batteries won't have
enough juice in them to provide more than a few bursts of light.
Enter: [Eneloop Rechargeable Batteries](http://www.eneloop.info/)
and their ilk. I recently saw about them in
[this Cool Tools post](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001921.php).
Looks to have almost all the good parts, but the ability to hold a
charge. I haven't purchased any yet, but they will be on the way
soon enough. I'm sure the technology will continue to improve, but
for me, this is a really significant improvement and hopefully will
be the start of a sea change that also means less stress on the
environment and less toxic shit leaking from batteries into our
ground water.
