title: Get Data From An API With window.fetch()
type: post
---

This is how I'm pulling data from a basic API:

```javascript
function getCurrentState() {
    let fetchUrl = 'https://example.com/some-api.json'
    return window.fetch(fetchUrl)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(response => console.log(response.someKey))
}

getCurrentState()
```

This works with a promise which I'm not totally sure about how you would use it with a return, but this gets you there for a start. 

The payload from the api should be:

```json
{ someKey: "some Value"}
```
