For those photographers out there. Do you guys use regular alkaline
AAs, rechargeable AAs, or a pack. I used to use a pack for most
thing, but I'm thinking about switching over to rechargeables AAs.
Way lighter and less expensive. I don't need super fast recharging,
but I'm wondering about cycle times. Any ideas?
