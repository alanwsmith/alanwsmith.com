A friend with a four year old daughter has done his best to keep
McDonald's out her world. She has never been in one, and he does
his best to limit her exposure to commercials and marketing
messages in general. He knew it was only a matter of time though
and then yesterday she caught part of an egg-mcmuffin commercial
and said, "Daddy, I want to go to McDonald's with you. I love
McDonald's". From not knowing about it to "Loving It" (which is
McD's current marketing slogan) in the blink of an eye. Yikes.
