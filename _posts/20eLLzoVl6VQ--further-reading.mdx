I was skimming other parts of the model rocket drug launching
report and saw this under Computer Forensic Jargon to Avoid  
Exact Duplicate: As defined in the Federal Rules of Evidence, a
duplicate is an exact representation of the original. Therefore,
the term "exact duplicate" is redundant.  

Language is fun.
