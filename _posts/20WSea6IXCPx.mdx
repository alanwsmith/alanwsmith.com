So far, not so good as I had hoped.  
Ever since MP3s first made their way into existence I've been
looking for a service like Yahoo's Music Unlimited (or Napster to
Go, etc...). I think the balance of paying a subscription for
access to a ton of music is a very happy medium between the theft
by consumers via downloads and the highway robbery by record
companies via hugely inflated CD prices.  
And the price is, at least theoretically, quite good for the Yahoo
offering. It's $5 a month if you sign up for a year at a time, or
$7 a month if you go month to month. I took a shot at the year plan
which means that I pay less for a month of music service than I do
for a 7&7 at most bars when you figure in tip.  
The problem at the moment is that they aren't really ready for
prime time. Their software is still in 'beta' which basically means
that they know it's going to screw up more than it should and some
stuff simply might not work. Now don't get me wrong some beta
release offerings work a lot better than others. Take
[Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/), for example. I would see
nothing wrong if Google classified that as a production level
service.  
The software that powers Yahoo's setup, their Music Engine, is at
the other side of the spectrum. It's often slow to start and more
often than not causing odd things to happen with the rest of my
machine. Since this is beta that would be fine except for the fact
that Yahoo is charging for it. It pisses me off when companies do
this, but I suppose it's more then norm than the exception. The
philosophy seems to be: Get as many people paying as early as
possible, even if it means launching a shoddy product.  
My current frustration with Yahoo is that I had songs downloaded
onto one of my machines that I transferred to my Dell DJ (more will
probably come on that later). The way the system works you have to
plug back into the net every 30days so the digital license can be
updated allowing you to play ~~your~~ the tunes for another 30
days. I was running low on disk space from the computer so I erased
the files from there, but left them on the portable player. It
seems that this isn't good enough since the licenses have expired
and I can't get them to update.  
I've got a request into Yahoo, but haven't heard if this how it's
supposed to be or if it's yet another bug. Either way, it's a poor
experience. All I want to do is listen to some tunes, but the whole
system makes that an exercise in frustration. Welcome to the Early
Adopter Penalty.  
The selection of songs seems pretty decent, but I've already run
into a bunch of stuff that isn't in their catalog at the moment.
I'd like to see something like PlayLouder which
[apparently](http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/netmusic/story/0,13368,1553962,00.html)lets
you download any song from sony as long as you are going thru their
service. Of course, it would be better if it was every song out
there. That's right, I'm still looking for the Celestial Jukebox.
