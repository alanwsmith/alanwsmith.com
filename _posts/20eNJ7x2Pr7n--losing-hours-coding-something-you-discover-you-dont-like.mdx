Just keeping the journal posting streak going here.

I wrote in my private journal this morning. Nothing salacious, it's just that sometimes I want to write without the world being able to see it. But, I want to get a good streak going with posting to the side everyday. So, here we are.

Not much to say other than I did another stream last night. I'm still amazed at the focus it gives me and the progress I make while doing it. 

I finished a tool that copies the urls and titles from all my open browser tabs. It cleans them up a little, removes duplicates and search pages, then formats them in markdown so I can pasted them into my stream notes. Took a while, but it's awesome and it's going to save a lot more time. More importantly, it removes a tedious task that makes me resistant to doing stream notes.

The process ended up being one of those things where I had an idea about what I wanted the final output to look like. But, when I saw it, I didn't like it. If I had known that up front, it would have saved me hours of work. But, that's just the way it goes sometimes. The time wasn't wasted. I was still making progress. It just turned out that the progress looped back on itself. 

Anyway, that's it for now. Gotta go get setup for another stream.
