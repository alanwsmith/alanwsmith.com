### [Start: 00:00:00] - Chatting and Review

Just chatting.

### [Time: 00:10:45] - Enhancing The Daily Link Grabber

I spent a while before the 3 hour mark trying to figure out this look which only adds items to an object if they don't match a set of exclude patterns. This is what I ended up with

    def clean_data_remove_excludes(self):
        new_object = {}
        for item in self.object_data:
            def include_item():
                for pattern in self.exclude_patterns:
                    if re.search(pattern, item):
                        return False
                return True
            if include_item():
                new_object[item] = self.object_data[item]
        self.object_data = new_object


TODO List for the grabber:

- Update timestamp in blogpost template
- Load config files (zero, one, or more)
- Move hard coded variables into a config file
- Filter out regex patterns (e.g.)
    - docs.google.com
    - localhost
    - www.alanwsmith.com
    - launchpad
    - work domains
    - amazon stuff that's not browsing
    - youtube links that aren't videos
- Flip the title of searching so "Google Search" is at the start.
- Update Stack Overflow to use share link
- Drop preface category from stackoverflow links.
