title: Native Windows RAW Image Viewer
---

Microsoft has a download for viewing RAW files from some digital
cameras without the need for an external application.
[RAW Image Thumbnailer and Viewer for Windows XP](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=d48e808e-b10d-4ce4-a141-5866fd4a3286&DisplayLang=en)
Just gave it a quick test and it seemed to work fine. I don't think
it alters the RAW file in anyway so it should make it easy to sort
images before running them thru PhotoShop. Of course, I use
[Breeze Browser](http://www.breezesys.com/BreezeBrowser/index.htm)
most of the time anyway, but it's nice to have the option.
