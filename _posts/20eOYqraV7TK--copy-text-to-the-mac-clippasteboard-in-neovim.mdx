```
"+y6j
```

will grab the next 6 lines


I've got this in my `~/.zshrc` file:

```
noremap <leader>y "+y
```

That let's me do:

```
,y6j
```

where, `,` is my leader key. 

It only saves one keystroke, but it feels a lot nicer

Note that I haven't been able to figure out how to do a single line. I rarely need it and just copy with the mouse. I'm sure there's a way though.
