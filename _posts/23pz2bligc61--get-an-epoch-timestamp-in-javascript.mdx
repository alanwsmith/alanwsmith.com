title: Get An Epoch Timestamp In JavaScript
slug: /posts/23pz2bligc61--get-an-epoch-timestamp-in-javascript
---

Epoch timestamps in JavaScript are the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since midnight on Jan. 1, 1970 UTC. I like using them because they are integers and are the same for any given time regardless of time zone. They're also handy since they are what's returned from `.now()` and `.getTime()` on a `Date`.

The epoch in millisecond for current time is available with:

```javascript
const epochTime = Date.now()
```

``` bash
// Outputs something like
1642449085896
```

Epoch in milliseconds for a specific time are obtained with:

```javascript
const backToTheFuture = new Date('Oct 21, 2015 07:28:00 GMT+05:00').getTime()
```

```bash
// Outputs:
1445394480000
```

To pull the epoch based timestamp back into a string do something like:

```javascript
const backToTheFutureString = new Date(backToTheFuture).toString()
```

Note: Mac/Linux/Unix system use seconds instead of millisecond for their epoch times. If you need to coordinate with one of them, use this for the current time:

```javascript
const epochTimeUnix = Math.round(Date.now() / 1000)
```

And this for a specific datetime:

```javascript
const backToTheFutureUnix = Math.round(new Date('Oct 21, 2015 07:28:00 GMT+05:00').getTime() / 1000)
```
