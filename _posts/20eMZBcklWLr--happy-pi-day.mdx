TODO: Figure out why this isn't working in MDX


Presenting what might be the song of the universe:

Kudos to a fun idea and nice execution.


Update: I did a little digging over lunch and found that Lars Erickson is the gentlemen who wrote "[Pi Symphony][1]". Here's his video:

<div style="text-align:center;"><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SzNlaxpD0zY?rel=0" frameborder="0"> </iframe></div>


The top video was down for a while. In the comments to the second one, Lars addresses the fact that he sent a take down notice for the top video, saying: "*Hey, I contacted him, but when people were referencing my work in his comments, he blocked their accounts. I am not trying to suppress the melody of pi, just someone taking credit for coming up with it this year when I did it 19 years ago. I completely understand, and hate doing it.*"


In case the top video goes down again, here's another Pi related thing to watch:
