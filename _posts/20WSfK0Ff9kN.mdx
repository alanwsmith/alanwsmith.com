This morning I spent what I'm sure is the most on gas I ever have
at any one time. Total was $45.82 for 15.9 gal. It's not as high as
other areas I'm sure, but $2.879/gal. + an very drained tank is a
punch. Looking back at the fact that I
[paid $2.33/gal.](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20060420.html)
on March 14 is a shock. Going up 54 cents in 42 days. That needs to
end soon.
