I own a film scanner that I've used maybe 20 times since I got it.
When I made the purchase my plan was to go through a bunch of my
old negs and get them scanned in so I could play with them, or at
least get a few of my favoriates into an online gallery. I just
never really got a chance to get down and dig into it. I have the
scanner here with me in Huntsville so that I can borrow some
negatives from a friend whose wedding I shot and get some images
for a sample book. I did the first few scans and started doing all
the spot toning (or whatever the name of the digital equivilent is)
that's required with old negs that have been printed off of several
times. Then I remember that the scanner has a feature called
Digital ICE that's supposed to help cut down on dust showing up in
the scan. Holy Cow. It works great. Check out the before and after
pics on
[this page](http://www.asf.com/products/ICE3/Example.shtml). My
negs aren't nearly as spotty as the example, but it does just as
good a job of clearing them.Â  I wish this tech had been discovered
and produced back in my old days when I was first transitioning to
photoshop, but was still shooting everything on film. Would have
saved me weeks worth of time that I spent spotting.
