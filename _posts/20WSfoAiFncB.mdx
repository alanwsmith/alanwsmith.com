Another example of poor design at The Omni. This time on the In Case Of Fire wall plaque. Normally, these signs have dotted lines that show how to get from where you are to an exit. In this case, you only get to the bridge. This bridge is a few stories up and you'd need to go down another flight of stairs to get the ground floor, and I'm not sure where the closest exit is. Kinda scary.
