When I was running a windows machine, I installed
[TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/) to make
[Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) a little easier to deal
with. It worked well, but always freaked me out a little that it
looked at everything in windows explorer to see if it was a working
copy. Occasionally, this would really slow things down when
navigating through network drives.

After switching over to using a Mac, I reverted back to doing
everything for Subversion with the command line. Like lots of
things, with a little practice, it's easy once you get the hang of
it and probably faster to boot. Even with that being the case, I
wanted to see what GUIs were available and found
[svnX](http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/development_tools/svnx.html).
It's a stand alone piece of Free Open Source Software that provides
a way do browse and work with repositories and working copies.

After a quick run through, it looks like a nice little application.
It's a little slow when looking at the repository across a network,
but for someone who doesn't want to have to mess with the command
line, it's should make dealing with Subversion approachable.
