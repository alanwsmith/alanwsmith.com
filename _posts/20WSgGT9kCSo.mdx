From time to time, I get individual emails (not bulk spam) from
people trying to sell me a product or service. It's a part of the
gig and I don't mind taking a look to see if it's something we
might be interested in. Occasionally, the people sending these
notes get a little tricky in their quest to get their pitch in
front of me. I recently got an email from a person I didn't
recognize, but the subject line had "follow up on questions". An
interesting tactic. It makes it sound like I've been in contact
with the person before and event asked them something. Psychology
of marketing would suggest this makes me much more likely to open
the email and then see their pitch. Unfortunately, there is one big
flaw with this tactic. While I like the psychologically theory
behinds this from an academic perspective, tricks like this piss me
off when used in the real world. So, I didn't even read the sales
pitch and I've added the entire company to my email kill file which
sends anything any of their employees sends me straight to spam
hell.
