Just watched
"[Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Prices](http://www.walmartmovie.com/)".
I haven't really shopped at Wal-Mart in a long time. Generally
speaking I wasn't a fan of the way they do business. After seeing
the documentary, I'll do my best never to shop there again and
encourage others to boycott it as well. The film obviously has an
agenda, but it doesn't go off into a raving rant. It does throw a
lot of info at you. Some of which I had an idea about, but to see
raw numbers really puts it in perspective. The movie itself could
have been put together a lot better, but it's well worth seeing.
I'm a good capitalist and have no problem with a company that looks
for new and improved ways to make money, but not when the price of
innovation is suppression of workers and destruction of
communities. I don't know if I would classify Wal-Mart as "Evil",
but after seeing the film, you would be hard pressed to convince me
that they aren't really shitty and a disgusting example of greed.
