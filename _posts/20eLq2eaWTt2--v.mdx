Just watched V for Vendetta. Moving aside for a moment the fact
that I find Natalie Portman mesmerizing, I think the film is
wonderful. Fantasy and fiction provide us with a great way to
examine ourselves and this one has that in spades. Thankfully
without becoming preachy, campy, overly self-important, or
sacrificing the quality of a story. This one will be added to the
collection.
