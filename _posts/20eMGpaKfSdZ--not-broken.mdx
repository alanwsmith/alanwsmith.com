So, I shot a wedding for a couple of friends on Saturday. Overall,
it went very well. At least I think it did. I'm not sure yet since
I haven't pulled down the images yet. I'm in the process of
cleaning up my digital photo archive and want to get that done
before I throw more images in. Anyway, one not so fun part of the
evening is when my I was adjusting my camera on it's tripod and
didn't have the tilt locked in. The result was the camera, while
staying attached to the tripod pitched forward with basically all
its weight and smashed my left pointer finger between it and the
tripod. Hurt pretty bad, but I was able to keep shooting without
much issue. If it had been my right hand I would have had to taken
a couple quick shots of whiskey to dull the pain to be able to keep
shooting since it would have been my shutter pressing finger. By
the end of the night, the finger had swollen a decent amount and
started to turn a little blue/gray. One of the guys at the wedding
was a doctor and said I should take it in a get X-rayed. He said it
was unlikely that it was serious but if it did break and did it a
certain way it could cause some pretty serious issues. The good
news for me is that according to the doctor I saw today, it's not
broken. Just need to keep some ice on it when I can. Take some
ibuprofen for the swelling and keep a little finger guard on it so
I don't keep knocking it into things. Interesting things in this
experience:
-   My doctor at the clinic looked exactly like Teller from Penn
    and Teller. He wore glasses, didn't do magic and, of course,
    talked, so I'm pretty sure it wasn't him but I suppose that could
    have been the trick.
-   The little exam room had a TV with cable and a remote in it.
    It's a great touch. Instead of that awkward just sitting and
    waiting on the little bench with the roll of paper on it, I channel
    surfed. Made for a much more comfortable wait.
-   I asked for the X-ray which they let me have. I don't think
    I've seen an X-ray of myself before. The only time I can think of
    that I'ce had an X-ray was before I was going up in a ROTC
    helicopter to shoot photos for a story in my college paper. They
    made me have an X-ray of my teeth so they had my dental records to
    match in case the thing went down. It's really odd to see an X-ray
    of part of my body. I've seen a few other X-rays before of other
    people, but this is the first time I've "seen" my own bones. They
    are much smaller than I would have thought.

So, the main outcome of all that is that I'm finally going to get a
ball head for my tripod instead of the one I have now where you
have to lock down three gears or risk serious injury.
