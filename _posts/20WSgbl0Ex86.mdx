As more and more of us become electronic cyborgs (via pacemakers,
internal drug delivery systems, etc...) the potential for
detrimental hacking of those devices increases as well. See, for
example,
[this story](http://venturebeat.com/2008/08/08/defcon-excuse-me-while-i-turn-off-your-pacemaker/)
found via [boingboing](http://boingboing.net/) about researchers
who have figured out how to hack into a pacemaker and shut it down
via remote control.

I can see this being part of a plot to a movie. Some political
leader dies and they think his pacemaker just gave out, but it was
really an assassination. Of course, there is frightening real world
potential for this.
