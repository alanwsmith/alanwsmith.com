In my tests of this, I got a 0 before I read results:

```
        query = ("SELECT * FROM genres")
        cursor = cnx.cursor()
        cursor.execute(query)
        print(cursor.rowcount)
        for row in cursor:
            pass
        print(cursor.rowcount)
```

Returned:

```
0
7
```

(with 7 being the actual number of items/rows). Seems that it's unbuffered, but the docs make it seem like it should be `-1`. 

Looks like it can be used with UPDATE statement though to get the number of rows updated. 



From the docs

```
count = cursor.rowcount
```

This read-only property returns the number of rows returned for SELECT statements, or the number of rows affected by DML statements such as INSERT or UPDATE. For an example, see Section 10.5.4, “MySQLCursor.execute() Method”.

For nonbuffered cursors, the row count cannot be known before the rows have been fetched. In this case, the number of rows is -1 immediately after query execution and is incremented as rows are fetched.
