title: Improvement idea for Wordpress iPhone App
slug: 20eMWQ0JuYgz--improvement-idea-for-wordpress-iphone-app

The Wordpess iPhone app is a pretty solid little piece of software.
(I'm writing this very post with it.) There are a few key upgrades
that would make it even more useful. 1) the ability to define the
maximum photo size when uploading from in the app. 2) The ability
to override the keyboard auto-rotation and select either a full
time horizontal or vertical layout. 3) Spellcheck. According to the
app's "about page" it is an open source app. Guess I'll take a look
and see if I can put in the changes myself.
