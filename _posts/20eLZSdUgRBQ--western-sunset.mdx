Well, not really Western for some people, but I figure since this
was taken in Key West, it counts. Went down there over the weekend
for a friends birthday. On the way back I heard rumors of snow in
other places. This makes the fact that it was a little cool in the
Keys okay, I suppose.

The trip, not surprisingly, was a bender. I'm actually sore from
drinking. Hell, I even danced while there which is very out of
character.
