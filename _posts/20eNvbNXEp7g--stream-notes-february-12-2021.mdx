### Notes

More work on the Hugo to Gatsby transition engine. I got images moved over along with non-index.md file. 

I also setup the converter for video links so those are changing as well. There's only a few other hugo short codes to deal with. I'll need to make a decision at that point about what else I need/want to deal with in terms of html inside the markdown. Probably not too much.
