TODO: See if you can just update one item? Or just add a new one? What about removing things, is that just setting to null



```javascript
const [activePlaylist, setActivePlaylist] = useState({title: "Old", song: [])


setActivePlaylist((previousState) => ({
    ...previousState,
    title: 'New',
    songs: [],
}))
```
