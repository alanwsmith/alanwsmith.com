title: Get A List Of Buffers From the Neovim API
type: post
---

(tags: count number)

These would go in a function and expect a `log(_MESSAGE_)` function to exist

```lua 
window_list = vim.api.nvim_list_wins()
for i = 1, #window_list do
    log(window_list[i])
end

buffer_list = vim.api.nvim_list_bufs()
for i = 1, #buffer_list do
    log(buffer_list[i])
end
```

From the prompt, this gets you all the buffers including hidden ones

```command
:ls!
```

For just the visible ones, use:

```command
:ls
```
