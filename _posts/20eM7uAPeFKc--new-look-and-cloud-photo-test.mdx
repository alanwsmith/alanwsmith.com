I've updated the "theme" of this blog to a new look. Mainly, I
wanted to get a wider base width. If you are on a smaller monitor
size, sorry about that, but progress marches on. I'm also using
this post to test a photo size (~~680x510~~ 620x510 if you are
wondering) to see how well it fits in the design. It's a shot I
took out the window on one of my many trips to Atlanta over the
past few weeks.
