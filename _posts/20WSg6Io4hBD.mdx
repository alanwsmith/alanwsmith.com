Probably obvious by this point, but I'm actually making a little
progress in things other than work over the past few days. It's a
refreshing change of pace. One example, a couple days ago, I was
finally able to get "Gallery" setup so that I can post photos again
and managed to do a basic edit and send up some photos I shot at
the [supershoots.com](http://www.supershoots.com/) workshop when I
was there with Dennis back in June. Here's
[the link](http://www.alanwsmith.com/gallery/view/htl7/) to the
images. The photo below is from the last night. As you can see,
things got a little weird, but a great time was had by all.
Especially the deer.
