title: Remove tmux Escape Delay To Avoid Leader Key Delays
slug: 20eOTmb3qG4Y--remove-tmux-escape-delay-to-avoid-leader-key-delays
---

Added this:

```
set -sg escape-time 0
```

To:

~/.tmux.conf

To turn off the escape delay since that was preventing the leader key from being able to be hit quickly.
