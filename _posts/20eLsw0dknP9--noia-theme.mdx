In Firefox, you can apply Themes to change the look and feel of
your browser. I use [Noia](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/72/).
I don't really care about the skin itself, though it is nice. The
main thing that I look for is that the right side scroll bar
touches the side of the desktop. This means that you can just slam
your mouse up against the side of the browser and you will be able
to click and scroll. A lot of themes that are out there (including
the Firefox default) have a one or two pixel border on the side so
you actually have to aim a little when you are trying to scroll.
This doesn't make sense to me since you have to be that much more
accurate with your mouse for a task that really doesn't reuire it.
