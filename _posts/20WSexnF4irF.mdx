Doing little work in the office I ordered a Pappa John's pizza for
dinner. I don't think they have been in this area very long and
this is the first time I think I've had a pie from them since I've
been in Florida. When I opened it up, the smell with the little
pepper they put in gave me an instant flood of memories from
college. Between ordering for myself and having it at parties I
probably had Pappa John's 1-2 times a week for a very long time.
Big happy nostalgia.
