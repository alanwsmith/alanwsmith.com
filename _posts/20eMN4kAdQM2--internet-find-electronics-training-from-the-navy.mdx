[United States Navy Electricity & Electronics Training Series - NEETS\*](http://www.phy.davidson.edu/instrumentation/NEETS.htm)
In the introduction, the texts are defined as a "self-study
course". Seems to be a really good way to teach yourself about
electronics if you were so inclined. Another example of how, if you
can just filter out the noise, it's possible to get a base
education in just about anything if you have access to a web
browser. From the intro:
> The Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series (NEETS) was
> developed for use by personnel in many electrical- and
> electronic-related Navy ratings. Written by, and with the advice
> of, senior technicians in these ratings, this series provides
> beginners with fundamental electrical and electronic concepts
> through self-study. The presentation of this series is not oriented
> to any specific rating structure, but is divided into modules
> containing related information organized into traditional paths of
> instruction. The series is designed to give small amounts of
> information that can be easily digested before advancing further
> into the more complex material. For a student just becoming
> acquainted with electricity or electronics, it is highly
> recommended that the modules be studied in their suggested
> sequence. While there is a listing of NEETS by module title, the
> following brief descriptions give a quick overview of how the
> individual modules flow together.

The first module - Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct
Current is 283 pages. Guessing it's pretty impressive learning
material.
