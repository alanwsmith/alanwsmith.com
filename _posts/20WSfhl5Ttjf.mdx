We have had cyborgs among us for a long time (think pacemakers) and
some bionics where thought can be used to control an external
instrument. It's amazing to
[see how far the tech has come](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14790160/?wid=11915773&GT1=8506).
Still a long way to go, but it's yet another case of what used to

human creativity and invention.
