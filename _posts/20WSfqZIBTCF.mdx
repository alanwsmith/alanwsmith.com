You should backup your stuff. It should be automatic. Ideally, it
should be at an "off-site" location. Enter [Mozy](http://mozy.com/)
You can backup 2GB of stuff to them for free. Or, you can pay
$5/month for unlimited storage. Apparently, they really do mean
unlimited. Photographers out there who shoot 5GB worth of images in
one shoot, are you listening? Right now, it's Windows only, but
there is a Mac version on the way according to their site.
