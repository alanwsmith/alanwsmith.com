title: Rename Multiple Files On The Command Line With zmv In zsh
type: post
---

This will rename all the `.mdx` files in the current directory to be `.txt` files

```bash
autoload zmv
zmv '(*).mdx' '$1.txt'
```

one liner:

```
autoload zmv; zmv '(*).mdx' '$1.txt'
```

autoload is require because `zmv` isn't loaded by default
