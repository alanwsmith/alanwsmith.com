I've mentioned before that
[South by Southwest](http://sxsw.com/ "South by Southwest")
releases music samplers with free MP3s on them from artists that
play the festival. I just looked up this years and found
[this page](http://hewgill.com/sxsw/ "SXSW Music Sampler torrents")
that points to torrents of all the samplers. Huge amount of music.

Sadly, I still haven't actually made it to a SXSW festival yet.
I'll be trying again next year.
