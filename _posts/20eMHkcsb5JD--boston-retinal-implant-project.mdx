![image](http://www.bostonretinalimplant.org/images/implant2.jpg)That's
right, [these folks](http://www.bostonretinalimplant.org/) are
working to make a replacement eye. Right now the goal is to treat
blindness. Once they get it working, one has to wonder how long
it'll be until the first elective one is installed/implanted. Also,
how long till we stop making the distinction between the words
"installed" and "implanted".
