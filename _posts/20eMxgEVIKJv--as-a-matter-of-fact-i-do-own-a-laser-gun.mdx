![Laser + Trigger = Laser Gun](/aws-20140201--1011-01a.jpg) 

Though I've had it for a while, it only just occurred to  me that I own a laser gun. Ten year old me would be so very impressed. At least, until I mentioned it doesn't vaporize targets. Just measures their surface temperature. 

Still: I OWN A LASER GUN!
