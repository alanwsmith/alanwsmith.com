I don't like the way Windows Explorer opens on default. From that
view, I almost always have to close something in order to get at
what I want. Instead, I change the target of the shortcut to this:
%SystemRoot%\\explorer.exe /e, /select, d:\\ Which opens in a basic
view with the drives waiting for me to figure out when one I want
to dive into.
