title: The ATFs Phone Number
---

Around the 4th of July, I was kicking around Phantom Firework's
site ([fireworks.com](http://www.fireworks.com/)) and came across
their page on
[Homemade and Illegal fireworks](http://www.fireworks.com/safety/homemade-fireworks.asp).
At the bottom, is the phone number for the ATF Hot Line for
reporting illegal explosives. Serious business, but the number
strikes me as funny: 1-888-ATF-BOMB
