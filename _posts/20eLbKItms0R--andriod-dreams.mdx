Another for the book list:
"[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345404475/sr=8-1/qid=1140657531/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-1506557-9535369?_encoding=UTF8)"
by Philip K. Dick This is the book Blade Runner was based on. Love
the fact that it was writen in '68. From a lot of what I've heard,
I think I'll end up reading a lot of his stuff. I hope that I enjoy
his work as much as I have William Gibson's. (By the way, Chris, if
you happen to read this, thanks again for the recommendation for
Neuromancer.) Speaking of William Gibson, I just went to his site
and read
[his bio](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/source/source.asp).
It's a great read. An odd thing to say about a bio, but true.
