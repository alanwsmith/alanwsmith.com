_TL;DR: The full code sample is at the bottom. It returns an array of arrays with file path segments that make it easy to assemble whatever you need out of it._

<hr />

## The Problem

Maybe it's just me, but getting a list of files in a directory always feels like it's more of a pain than it should be. Especially when recursion is involved.

## The Hypothesis

I've come to realize that the problem isn't as much how I'm getting the list of files as what I'm returning. Namely, an array of files listed as strings. 

The problem isn't the array, it's the strings. 

Instead of a single text field, I've started returning an array of arrays. Each file gets it's own with five value in it:

- Absolute path to the root directory queried
- The relative path for any sub-directories
- The file name itself (including the extension)
- The name of the file without the extension 
- The extension by itself


## Example Output

Given a tree like this on my desktop:

```txt
.
├── start_here
│   ├── 1.png
│   ├── 2.png
│   └── sub1
│       ├── 3.png
│       └── sub2
│           └── 4.png
```

The code produces 

```txt
[ '/Users/alan/Desktop/start_here', '', '1.png', '1', '.png' ]
[ '/Users/alan/Desktop/start_here', '', '2.png', '2', '.png' ]
[ '/Users/alan/Desktop/start_here', 'sub1', '3.png', '3', '.png' ]
[ '/Users/alan/Desktop/start_here', 'sub1/sub2', '4.png', '4', '.png' ]
```


That setup lets me operate on the files in whatever way I need by joining the paths. 

A big example for me is making a new directory in another location with the same structure. Joining the new root to the sub directories lets me make the new structure and then update files as necessary by joining the names on as well. 

Using the part of the filename without the extension lets me convert image files to another format without having to further parse the names. 

Two optional parameters determine if the listing is recursive and if it should return hidden files. These values default to true and false, respectively.





## The Code

The JavaScript version of the code looks like this:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

const fs = require('fs')
const path = require('path')

const listDir = function (
  rootDir,
  isRecursive = true,
  hiddenFiles = false,
  subDir = '',
  fileList = []
) {
  if (rootDir.charAt(0) !== '/') {
    rootDir = path.resolve(rootDir)
  }

  const subDirExpanded = path.join(rootDir, subDir)

  fileNames = fs.readdirSync(subDirExpanded)
  fileNames.forEach((fileName) => {
    filePath = path.join(subDirExpanded, fileName)
    subDirPath = path.join(subDir, fileName)
    if (fs.statSync(filePath).isDirectory()) {
      if (isRecursive) {
        fileList = listDir(
          rootDir,
          isRecursive,
          hiddenFiles,
          subDirPath,
          fileList
        )
      }
    } else {
      const fileDetails = [
        rootDir,
        subDir,
        fileName,
        path.parse(fileName).name,
        path.parse(fileName).ext,
      ]

      if (hiddenFiles === true) {
        fileList.push(fileDetails)
      } else if (fileName.charAt(0) !== '.') {
        fileList.push(fileDetails)
      }
    }
  })

  return fileList
}
```

Usage looks like the:

```javascript
const files = listDir(
    '/Users/alan/Desktop/start_here'
)
```

And with the optional parameters:

```javascript
const files = listDir(
    '/Users/alan/Desktop/start_here', 
    false, 
    true
)
```


## And, Done

I don't know how many times I've looked up how to get a directory listing based on what I was trying to do. Feels like I can just reach for this and get at least an 80/20 out of it.
