Just installed a programmable, digital thermostat in the house.
With summer effectively here we'll see what type of difference it
makes in the power bill. I keep the house at 75 degrees, but there
is no need to keep it there while I'm gone. So, I'll let it up to
86 during the day while I'm gone (which is also when the difference
in outside temperature is the highest). Should be interesting.
