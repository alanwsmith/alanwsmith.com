Five years ago, I entered a major bipolar depression. It took me to the darkest places possible and dragged my photography down with it. My desire to shoot was laid waste.

As I came out of the depression, my interest in images didn't return. It was gone so long I'd gotten used to the idea that it would never would.

But, it did. 

It's back and it's brilliant and it's a relief. 

But, I'm different now. Re-tuned and re-tooled through the miracles of modern medicine. I could feel the desire, but there was an aversion to my old gear. It's heavy and I'm lighter now. 

So, I bought a new tool. It's lean and light and perfect.

Time will tell how many frames we'll take together, but this is the first and I couldn't be happier.
