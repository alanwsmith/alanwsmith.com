### Title: Changing The Intro

<YouTubeVideo id="rz9_XNtAMIY" />

Today's Topics Include:

- The history of the intro and changing it up
- Working in public
- A brief mention of [Digital Gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/)
- The Workshop and The Woodshed
- Cleaning the blog
- Considering an audio bumper intro (which retroactively ended up being music queues)
- Considering a podcast episode that's only sign language
- We're gonna get into some tech, but this ain't no tech show
- The possibility of popularity 
- Ejecting 

Post show idea:

- See if there's software that would could use to make sign language versions of the podcast. At first blush id doesn't look like this has been solved though there is [this dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02351) to look at.

Auto-Generated Transcript (I'm in the process of getting this formatted)

00:01
[Music]
00:05
all right so
00:06
now we're do that a little bit
00:07
differently hang on we're starting like
00:09
this
00:10
so
00:11
i've come to a decision
00:13
and the decision is
00:15
we're gonna change the way potentially
00:16
that we're opening these not potentially
00:18
we're changing the way we open these
00:19
in
00:20
all of the ones of these episodes that
00:22
i've recorded prior to this
00:24
which is kind of like the before times
00:27
uh they were done in my car and in my
00:29
car the way that i would do it
00:31
that i kind of like landed on after a
00:32
while was i would
00:35
be parked somewhere because i would
00:36
always start from a parked place get the
00:38
camera set up and the mic set up etc and
00:40
then get everything set up and then like
00:43
pause for a second
00:44
put the car in gear and then say hello
00:46
world welcome to this edition of
00:49
whatever the name of the thing is that
00:50
we came up with that time
00:52
that's how i started the first one of
00:54
these right it's like hey hello world
00:55
like i'm gonna keep doing the same thing
00:56
and i was thinking about that i was like
00:57
hey let's go through this but like it
00:58
didn't it doesn't feel right to do that
01:03
like it doesn't
01:04
this is now a new thing and it's like
01:06
it's a new thing in two different ways
01:07
two well like way number one is
01:12
this is a brand new thing i'm doing a
01:13
different location and i'm also pushing
01:14
this out like i actually posted the
01:16
first one of these right so the thing
01:18
has happened um but also just doesn't
01:20
feel like the vibe didn't feel right for
01:23
doing a hello world thing all the time
01:25
with this like it's
01:26
and i and the trick is i so i need to
01:29
find
01:30
a opening or an opening and i kind of
01:33
been thinking about a little bit about
01:34
that back and forth in my head where
01:37
i don't necessarily like would be great
01:39
is um if you could do music right so
01:41
uh the other thing that i did a long
01:43
time ago with the cars when i first
01:45
started doing this
01:46
is um i would play
01:48
i'd have a track playing and off it was
01:50
whatever was on the radio and i just
01:52
have the radio kind of crank so you
01:53
could hear the you could hear the music
01:54
in the background um or kind of i guess
01:56
foreground at that point and i turned
01:58
the music down like hello world i'm
02:00
going and this is we're doing the thing
02:01
et cetera but like that's gonna get
02:03
copyright struck and taken down i don't
02:04
have to deal with that so i stopped
02:06
doing that got to the hell world thing
02:08
etc but like
02:10
i kind of i need to figure out what i
02:12
want to do for the beginning of these
02:14
um and this is
02:17
in line with another thing that we will
02:19
get to talking about a bunch here which
02:21
is this idea of
02:24
learning in practice the idea of a
02:25
digital garden the idea of doing things
02:27
in public and working on them in public
02:29
so
02:30
i'm just running this stuff like i've
02:32
been doing it for a while but i haven't
02:33
posted it now i'm posting it but as i'm
02:35
posting it it actually
02:37
it's almost like i've been doing a play
02:40
where
02:41
uh i've been rehearsing and rehearsing
02:42
rehearsing rehearsing rehearsing and
02:44
then now i'm ready to actually do the
02:46
performance and i guess it's a little
02:47
bit more like i don't know jazz and
02:49
improvisation in terms of like i've
02:51
practiced a whole bunch
02:53
with all this stuff that's never been
02:54
seen
02:55
and now we're gonna get up and we're
02:56
gonna do the gig
02:57
but while we do the gig like as soon as
02:59
the gig
03:00
becomes its own thing
03:02
it's gonna have its own
03:04
kind of uh maturation process maturation
03:07
maturation i don't know how to say a
03:08
word but like it's gonna mature in and
03:10
of itself it's gonna become its own
03:12
thing and so
03:14
part of that also is gonna be like this
03:16
could be a very produced thing like i
03:17
could go through
03:19
and i could keep refining this a little
03:20
bit i could record a couple episodes and
03:22
then not actually post them and then go
03:23
okay what did i learn from that one let
03:25
me go through and like record these and
03:27
then like oh i want to have an intro
03:28
okay how do i want to do the intro well
03:29
i wanted to say hello world no we didn't
03:31
try that didn't work let's try this and
03:32
like we could workshop it and workshop
03:34
it and workshop it or would shed it
03:35
depending on which way you want to call
03:36
that um
03:38
which head being an old school term for
03:39
uh
03:40
in
03:41
band
03:42
at least the the way that i always heard
03:44
woodshed was like if you
03:46
had a piece of music that you're working
03:47
on and you weren't quite there you you
03:49
took it to the woodshed or you got taken
03:51
to the woodshed to go figure it out to
03:53
go figure out how to do it um and i like
03:55
the idea of woodchat in workshop both um
03:58
but i i'm a
04:01
generally like woodshed kind of have an
04:03
uh a connotation of kind of getting your
04:04
tail kicked um
04:07
the
04:08
so like i'd prefer to think about stuff
04:10
more as a workshop of taking something
04:11
back to shopping it and workshopping it
04:13
um so that's that's gonna be this
04:16
process too and like so there's gonna be
04:17
a whole bunch of that as we go through
04:18
this and like welcome to the early
04:19
episodes where we figure this stuff out
04:21
over time
04:22
we'll hit the rhythm of the things and
04:24
we will solve the problems for as long
04:27
as
04:28
they see fit to see themselves be solved
04:31
and what i mean by that is
04:33
um i kind of been going back i've been
04:34
working on my website for the past i
04:36
don't know a little while um
04:38
changing the software underneath it that
04:40
hosts it from something called gatsby to
04:43
something called uh next js
04:46
um if you don't know what either of
04:47
those are don't worry about it we can
04:49
talk about them later or not it's fine
04:50
it is completely irrelevant but for
04:52
those of you under such things those are
04:53
the the pieces of software that i'm
04:54
messing with
04:56
but as i'm doing this move
04:58
um i'm also going through and cleaning
05:00
up from the prior five moves that i've
05:03
done of the website because there was
05:05
so i'm at next js now before next there
05:08
was gatsby before now gatsby there was
05:10
hugo before hugo there was jekyll before
05:11
jekyll there was wordpress for wordpress
05:13
it was hand coded um and there was
05:16
blogger in there somewhere i don't
05:17
remember but
05:19
there's all this cruft that's built up
05:21
over time with all of these posts so
05:23
like the pages of the pages but like
05:26
they're not formatted the same because
05:28
like some some of them got written three
05:30
pieces of in a software
05:32
three pieces of software ago and some of
05:34
them i've just written today
05:36
and like
05:37
they're all just words and text
05:40
in a file
05:42
but the format of them is different and
05:44
what i mean by format is
05:47
if you think like about a table of um of
05:50
rows and columns and so like the one
05:53
column would be like title and then the
05:55
title would be on the first row uh for
05:57
the first page would be like this is my
05:59
site hello world
06:01
second row would be like welcome to the
06:03
podcast and then
06:05
another column on the table
06:07
would be the text
06:09
another column would be the date
06:12
well like with the date for example
06:15
i have four different columns that all
06:17
are associated with the date
06:20
some files have one of those filled out
06:22
and not the other three
06:24
some have a different one filled out and
06:25
not the other three some of them have
06:27
don't have any filled out some have all
06:28
of them filled out like it's just it's
06:30
kind of a mess
06:32
so what i've been going through uh the
06:34
past little while in the past kind of
06:36
major push that i've done on the project
06:37
on the site is
06:39
to push all that stuff down so that i
06:41
take a look at those four dates and say
06:44
okay
06:45
let's look at these four dates let's
06:46
pick the one that we like the best and
06:49
let's get everything under that column
06:51
and delete the other three so it's that
06:53
type of cleanup and that type of process
06:56
but as part of that too what i've been
06:58
looking at is the transition of both
07:02
that type of metadata the dates etc and
07:06
as well as the content itself for 15
07:09
years like i've got 15 years of blog
07:10
here and
07:14
stuff has changed like a lot in terms of
07:16
my thinking in terms of the way i write
07:17
in terms of the way that i post stuff
07:19
just this actual structure right those
07:20
dates those titles
07:22
those time stamps whether or not
07:24
identify something if it's updated or
07:25
not
07:26
all of those things have changed and i
07:28
wouldn't have gotten to here if i hadn't
07:31
gotten through all of that stuff
07:34
like i could have just started now
07:37
and everything would have been cool and
07:38
it would have been everything lined up
07:40
and clean all looking exactly the
07:42
same or
07:44
i could have like kept going a little
07:46
bit and stopping and keeping a little
07:47
bit stopping and trying to mess with it
07:48
or i could have not changed anything at
07:50
all
07:51
but like this that's not how stuff tends
07:53
to work with
07:55
practice and procedures i guess i don't
07:58
know but like it's it's moved and it's
08:00
migrated so
08:01
what does that mean for this
08:03
i don't know what i'm gonna do
08:05
in episode 50 for
08:08
uh an intro like
08:10
i know that episode one i did hello
08:12
world not really digging it
08:15
and to the point we're not not really
08:16
digging up to the point we're like not
08:17
gonna do that
08:19
this being episode two and by the way
08:21
maybe not two we'll find out like i may
08:23
put another episode in front of this
08:24
like this is all like fungible at this
08:26
point like it's this is the primordial
08:28
primordial ooze of podcast
08:30
the the the pr the
08:33
potteries ooze no that's not nevermind
08:36
um
08:38
so we're to go through and like this
08:40
this stuff is affirming itself out a
08:41
little bit that's probably the wrong
08:43
word and
08:44
over time i won't have to think too much
08:46
about those things but while we're here
08:47
we're doing this thing and
08:49
i'm not a huge fan
08:52
of a certain type of navel gazing that
08:55
happens
08:58
sometimes with these projects
09:00
that
09:02
yeah
09:04
and i i can't tell you what the
09:05
distinction is between it and between
09:07
what i'm doing and maybe there is no
09:08
distinction and i'm just you know giving
09:10
myself leeway because it's my thing
09:12
but
09:15
i don't know let's listen to another
09:16
podcast and they were talking about a
09:17
little bit about like hey we're gonna do
09:18
this and like we're not really sure
09:20
about this and like all this stuff it's
09:21
like i kind of don't want to hear that
09:23
but at the same time it's good to hear
09:24
that
09:26
so like i guess i don't know i don't
09:28
actually have no idea where this is
09:29
going so like this one whatever we're
09:31
gonna so here's okay we'll back this all
09:33
the way up to the start right we're
09:34
gonna start at the start
09:35
probably what i think i'm gonna do
09:37
is
09:39
add in some type of little like bloop
09:42
bloop sound at the start of this so
09:44
there's some indication some signature
09:46
on the podcast that it is one of my
09:48
things like it could just be me starting
09:50
and being my voice because
09:52
my voice is my voice people's voices are
09:54
independent like we can hear things and
09:55
know what's happening but like i kind of
09:58
like this idea of just like this little
09:59
like
10:00
of like something and you know uh
10:03
cube big hero
10:04
six eight
10:07
who do we appreciate sorry um
10:10
i'm gonna do that a lot by the way when
10:11
i'm in this mood so
10:13
yes i don't know we'll see how that goes
10:14
and yeah so this is this is one of those
10:17
i feel like i'm skipping around so i'm
10:18
skipping around more than i generally
10:20
would do
10:21
about this type of thing in hemingham
10:22
right now but like that's going to
10:24
happen sometimes so hoorays strap in um
10:27
again one of the things i said in the
10:28
last one was
10:30
if you're not digging this first one or
10:32
the second one go listen to like five
10:34
from now
10:35
and it's funny to be able to say that
10:36
because i know that there's gonna be
10:38
five or ten from now like they're going
10:39
to exist uh like i've done this long
10:42
enough that i know that those things
10:43
could happen i'm gonna make them i'm
10:44
gonna post them especially because i've
10:45
already been posting them but it's kind
10:46
of this weird time traveling thing in
10:48
terms of like
10:50
i and especially the other thing i've
10:52
been thinking about is like i'm gonna
10:53
post some of these other episodes that
10:55
i've done in the car
10:57
two years ago but they will go in the
10:59
timeline in front of this one or behind
11:01
depending on whichever direction you're
11:02
looking at so
11:04
like
11:05
i just i've started to see this thing
11:08
as
11:10
much less constrained
11:13
than i was originally thinking about
11:15
doing it and that's one of the keys of
11:17
actually getting in and doing it is like
11:18
i had all these kind of ideas in my head
11:21
about
11:22
the structure and the way that it would
11:23
work and like even after having done it
11:25
for a couple of years and just rolling
11:26
in i thought it would basically be the
11:28
same thing but just changing this
11:30
position just changing the scene
11:32
just doing it on this mic instead of in
11:34
the car and actually having hardware
11:35
that's probably not going to fail on me
11:36
quite as much
11:37
uh you'll get to that later because the
11:39
hardware failed to punch me on the car
11:40
and i was kind of frustrating but sadly
11:42
um
11:43
but just doing that change like this is
11:45
this is already a very different thing
11:46
for me even though it's mostly the same
11:49
but like those independent
11:53
minor things add up to pretty profound
11:55
differences and like it's super cool and
11:57
super fun to play with and that's the
11:59
other thing is i get to play with this
12:00
now so like i have this other thing and
12:01
it's like
12:02
i thought i knew more about what this
12:04
was gonna be 48 hours ago and now i
12:06
don't
12:07
and like that's cool this is got a
12:09
pretty good idea right it's gonna be me
12:10
talking into a microphone about things
12:13
okay that the check that's gonna happen
12:15
um if not who knows maybe we'll do
12:17
finals
12:19
what would a podcast episode be like
12:21
that was just sign language
12:26
kind of ridiculous question but like
12:27
what would that be
12:29
like so i'm doing these on video
12:32
like so
12:34
would you
12:35
so okay so i'm gonna post these things
12:37
on
12:39
youtube i also figured out that i'm
12:40
going to go on soundcloud and get them
12:41
to i
12:43
phone and android somehow i don't know
12:44
we'll figure all that stuff out
12:45
but
12:47
there is a video component of these
12:49
podcasts
12:51
and again i'm having to expand my
12:54
definition or i have i have expanded it
12:56
took some effort
12:57
um or it took some re-examination
13:00
and re
13:01
expansion
13:03
to
13:04
update my bill my thinking what a
13:06
podcast is
13:08
and what i mean by that specifically is
13:10
to me a podcast is was is mp3s delivered
13:14
over an rss feed
13:15
so as soon as you add video into the mix
13:17
it's not a podcast to me that's a vlog
13:20
but i don't think that's the case
13:21
anymore and like language is shifty and
13:23
moves and like is really fun to watch
13:25
and play with like that but so for me
13:27
i've actually clicked into this idea
13:28
that the video is part is like the video
13:31
is as much the podcast as the mp3 is
13:34
as is the rss feed that's underneath it
13:36
which is actually what tells
13:38
your you know your phone to like go get
13:40
the specific episode that's the the tack
13:42
underneath there um
13:44
another thing i guess i should
13:46
just now's a good time to bring this up
13:48
is
13:49
i'm gonna talk at several different
13:51
levels about technology um i am pretty
13:54
technically adept i do computer
13:55
programming uh
13:57
professionally and um
14:00
personally uh probably i don't know for
14:02
myself and for an organization that pays
14:04
me money to do it um it's not that's not
14:06
my primary role but it is something that
14:08
i do
14:09
so
14:10
and i work on architecture of systems et
14:12
cetera so like i can get
14:14
pretty far down into the technical stuff
14:16
um there are lo there are layers below
14:18
that i can understand if somebody guides
14:20
me but i do not know but i can at least
14:22
figure out what's going on because i
14:23
have enough of the
14:25
um
14:27
i've descended far enough down the
14:28
staircase that if somebody holds my hand
14:30
and has a flashlight they can show me
14:32
around and show me these other things
14:34
that i don't yet know um
14:37
at the same time i don't want this to be
14:39
uh like a tech podcast like this isn't
14:41
gonna be a development podcast this
14:43
isn't gonna be a developer con podcast
14:44
this isn't gonna be me talking about um
14:48
next js that i'm using to do my site
14:50
with the tailwind css system and
14:53
rust and you know cool xml
14:57
xml is probably not really cool these
14:58
days but you know if
15:00
so if someone like if some of the tech
15:03
stuff and it's weird because like who
15:04
like how
15:05
what is my audience who is my audience
15:07
right know your audience
15:09
big old thing in like communication in
15:13
the world in general is like know your
15:15
audience
15:17
so my audience is going to be the people
15:19
who are into this but at the same time
15:22
if you're into whatever this is or if
15:24
you're into this thing if you're into
15:26
the pot of allen which is apparently
15:27
what i'm calling it now they're not
15:29
they're not apparently that's like
15:30
that's what's that is the new name of
15:31
the thing it has been rechristened as
15:33
the pot of allen because i've got the id
15:34
of allen the site of ellen the bot of
15:37
alan it's just like that's that is
15:39
turned into my um
15:41
uh
15:42
i don't want to use the word brand
15:43
because that sounds super corporaty but
15:45
like it's my
15:46
nomenclature for things
15:49
but
15:51
if you're
15:52
if you're into parts of this but other
15:54
parts of it you're not just ignore them
15:56
especially the techie stuff like i'm
15:57
going to crack wise on tech stuff
15:58
sometimes
16:00
because
16:02
that is that like i i live in that world
16:05
so that's the thing but like if i start
16:06
cracking jokes about xml and like you
16:09
don't get it like it is not
16:12
if i could if i could talk to each one
16:14
of you individually i would know whether
16:15
or not to gauge that or to throw that
16:16
joke in
16:17
i don't have that capability yet um
16:19
maybe through ai and machine learning we
16:21
can figure that stuff out with all bunch
16:23
of if-then statements and
16:25
make some determinations but for now i
16:27
just have to kind of do this to the
16:29
audience
16:30
that is the people who are into the
16:33
thing but like they're not all gonna hit
16:34
and also some of them are going to be
16:36
just bad jokes and not funny anyways but
16:38
like
16:38
discounting that if there's a thing you
16:40
don't understand don't worry about it
16:41
tweet at me if you don't understand a
16:44
thing or google it because you can also
16:45
probably find it out but like
16:47
i would be happy to
16:49
amusingly i would be happy to explain
16:51
xml jokes um that said
16:54
i also have to recognize that there is
16:57
the billionth percentile chance
17:00
that
17:01
non-trivial amounts of people listen to
17:02
this so
17:05
maybe don't always they'll tweet at me
17:07
um
17:08
hopefully i i kind of hope that's a
17:09
problem i kind of hope that's not a
17:10
problem right you're gonna get both of
17:12
those things but like if this if i do
17:14
this for another two years
17:16
and any number of people get it and
17:18
collect over time like that could be a
17:20
decent number of people um
17:23
i so like opening up a communication and
17:25
so this is this is one of the things
17:26
that's weird to think about too right
17:28
and so not not just for me but just for
17:30
any of us like if we do a thing
17:32
that puts us in public
17:36
like
17:37
there are very direct lines of
17:38
communications to us in public now like
17:40
how how does one deal
17:43
with that because like right now ain't
17:45
no problem
17:46
no big thing but like
17:48
any like moving into and up to the
17:51
celebrity and not talking about like pop
17:53
culture celebrities but talking about
17:55
like
17:56
a celebrity in your field so
17:58
no matter what you do i expect that
18:01
there is some person out there who
18:04
if they're speaking at a conference
18:05
you're like ooh i would like to go to
18:06
that conference to hear that person talk
18:08
about the thing that they're doing um
18:10
and i'm talking now more a bit of a
18:12
professional thing i recognize that i'm
18:13
kind of making a
18:15
judgment jump here or
18:17
uh
18:18
not a judgment jump a
18:20
something jump i don't know cause like i
18:22
but here actually here's the question i
18:24
i don't know enough
18:25
i'm gonna give i'm gonna step in stuff
18:26
by the way all the time um
18:29
but my guess is there are people out
18:30
there that you'd like to go see there
18:31
are some amount of celebrity that are
18:33
outside of the top level of celebrity
18:35
also i need an eject button for when i
18:37
kind of start wrapping myself down a
18:39
wormhole that i can't figure out to get
18:40
out of so like but i don't want to have
18:42
a cheesy eject sound but like i'm just
18:44
going to say i'm going to eject um
18:48
but yeah so like
18:50
i don't know
18:51
if it becomes surprising
18:53
here's i guess here's here's the
18:54
interesting thing about
18:57
permanent media and i'm using permanent
18:59
with you know an asterix on it that
19:01
nothing is but
19:04
if we so like again i'm in this i'm in
19:06
this head space because i'm looking back
19:07
at blog posts from 15 years ago and like
19:10
so if i had said 15 years ago hey
19:13
i've written this post that's telling
19:15
you how to do this particular thing in
19:17
this particular programming language
19:19
if you don't understand it reach out to
19:21
me
19:22
cool
19:24
that that's 15 years plus however much
19:27
longer i'm alive and the site stays
19:28
alive
19:29
that
19:31
that question or that offer is open
19:35
and like that's kind of staggering
19:39
so maybe don't tweet at me
19:42
but maybe do i don't know like
19:44
and again i'm thinking about this in my
19:46
perspective right because we we tend to
19:47
think about our the world through our
19:48
own filters but like just the
19:50
staggeringness of like leaving um
19:52
leaving a message doing a thing out in
19:54
public
19:56
and making a statement and then having
19:58
that statement
20:01
not
20:03
dissipate with the echoes of time
20:07
like that's
20:08
that's not a thing
20:12
that
20:13
was in the power
20:14
of all but the fewest of human beings
20:18
for all but the briefest time period of
20:21
history and and now we all have it
20:25
so easily
20:27
and like it's just
20:29
i i don't know if we still have
20:33
and i'm not saying yay or nay i'm saying
20:35
i don't know if we have fully
20:39
not comprehended but adapted or like
20:42
rolled into the world where like that's
20:45
ins that's our
20:47
internal knowledge of the thing is how
20:49
that stuff works i mean it's something
20:51
we can't have right because like
20:54
my generation did not have
20:56
front ends and purposes the internet so
20:59
or phones so like
21:02
three generations from now will actually
21:04
be able to look at people and say okay
21:07
can you see the difference or how does
21:09
it feel to live in this world you all
21:11
know it because you've already you've
21:12
always already all lived in it
21:14
but
21:17
the people and some of us of of this
21:19
particular
21:21
being aliveness like right now
21:24
regardless of your age
21:26
to degree if you're eight probably can't
21:27
really
21:28
do this um comparison yet because you're
21:32
you've seen phones and ipads since you
21:34
were born but like
21:37
the generational stuff being able to
21:38
watch to be able to see both sides of it
21:41
like
21:42
it's just interesting and like i then
21:44
this is not a get off my lawn kind of
21:45
thing this is just like oh that's
21:47
interesting it was this and now it's
21:48
that
21:49
and also recognizing that like these
21:51
some of these things are new in a way
21:53
particularly that we may not have really
21:55
thought about with them being new yet
21:57
like we may not get the newness of the
21:59
idea um for another generation or two
22:03
i have no idea i got on that out of
22:05
starting out with a podcast um but so
22:11
that that that i tell you what that'll
22:12
do it for now um i'm trying to figure
22:14
out how long to make these things run uh
22:16
there's
22:17
i can't actually see a timer right now
22:18
so it's fine but
22:21
that's a little bit of what's gonna
22:22
happen i will settle down on these a
22:24
little bit more as we get through them
22:25
like this is still
22:26
[Music]
22:27
this still feels new to me even though
22:29
it's a thing that i've been doing
22:31
a version of for a while but it still
22:33
has the newness of it um also i do get
22:36
that
22:37
hyped up a lot so like that's kind of
22:40
how this stuff is gonna roll um
22:42
sometimes yeah sometimes an a but often
22:44
slightly less
22:47
uh tempo'd i guess uh paste
22:50
what's allegro what's the name of um
22:52
what's the name of the music
22:54
allegro i think
22:56
there's an a word
22:58
for music that means going fast
23:01
i think might be a lego whatever
23:03
i can remember forte piano allegro and
23:05
then i can't remember what the slow
23:06
tempo is whatever music words so
23:10
that'll run for now um
23:12
you all have a good one take it easy be
23:13
kind we will see you next time until
23:16
then
23:16
uh
23:18
be kind
23:19
cheers
