title: Another ATL trip
---

Took another trip to Atlanta yesterday. Left my house about 6am and made it back a little after midnight. 

Two flights, and several hours of meetings make for a long ass day. It was almost a lot longer. A couple hours before we left for the airport, it started to snow.

Thankfully, we made it out. We were delayed about an hour and a half, but managed to get past the de-icing line which would have taken another two hours. 

I haven't seen snow in years, but I wasn't too excited to see it. 

Worked out okay though.
