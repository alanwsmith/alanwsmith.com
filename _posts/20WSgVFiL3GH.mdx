Was reading another blog post where the author mentioned his
Myers-Briggs personality type. When I took the test a couple years
ago at work it said I'm an INTJ. From the current wikipedia page:
> INTJs are strong individualists who seek new angles or novel ways
> of looking at things. They enjoy coming to new understandings.

While I take things like the Myers-Briggs test with a grain of
salt, that seems about right to me. If you are interested, take a
look at the rest of the
[INTJ page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTJ) and if you know me,
judge for yourself.
