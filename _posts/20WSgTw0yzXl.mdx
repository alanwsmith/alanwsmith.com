Found this little guy when I was leaving the office one night and
decided to shoot a few portraits with my little point and shoot
camera.

A couple times I got too close and he did this:

Note: in this shot he was facing the other direction from the
portrait above. I probably couldn't get that shot again with a
point and shoot if I tried 1,000 times. I think would fall into
what Henri Cartier-Bresson calls
[The Decisive Moment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Cartier-Bresson#The_Decisive_Moment).
From the Wikipedia article:
> "Photography is not like painting," Cartier-Bresson told the
> Washington Post in 1957. "There is a creative fraction of a second
> when you are taking a picture. Your eye must see a composition or
> an expression that life itself offers you, and you must know with
> intuition when to click the camera. That is the moment the
> photographer is creative," he said. "Oop! The Moment! Once you miss
> it, it is gone forever."
