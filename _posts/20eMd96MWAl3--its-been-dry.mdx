Even with the decent amount of rain we've gotten over the past week or two, it's been dry in my area. To wit, I'm in the dark red "D4 - Exceptional" drought area on this map<sup>1</sup>:

Which explains why the little pond in my back yard is so low.

You can get a better idea of how much the water has dropped in this shot:

For another perspective, the water level used to consistently reach all the way to the grate in the cement wall in this shot.

I'm half expecting to look out one day soon and see a bunch of fish cooking on dry land.
