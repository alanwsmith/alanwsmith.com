My digital camera is now two generations old (the 10D). In the past
there has been lots of internet talk about the a "back-focus"
problem with it. Especially combined with certain lenses. I never
ran into this problem. That is until I got my new (to me) wide
angle lens.  
The first time I really shot with it was last weekend when I shot
that Matts. After looking at the images I thought I had completely
forgotten what I was doing when I'm shooting. Nothing looked sharp
at all. That is, until I started looking at the backgrounds. Guess
who just setup a lens/body combo with back focusing problems.
Piss.  
I've really been interested in getting the new 5D, but I wasn't
even going to seriously consider it until next year. While I like
the idea of having the camera, I'm really not excited about the
fact that it looks like I'll pretty much have to purchase it in
order to be able to shoot anything wide angle. This is particularly
a pain since shooting with wide glass is pretty much my favorite.

P.S. Yes, I know I could focus manually, but I'm really not
interested in that. I've gotten too used to the auto aspect. Plus
it's a pain with the smaller viewfinder size.
