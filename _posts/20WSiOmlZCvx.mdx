### Overview

This is the second part of exploring Django to make a tutorial in order to teach myself how to use it. 

### [Start: 00:00:00] - Review Existing Draft

The stream starts off running through the initial draft of the process.


### [Time: 01:19:52] - Building A Checklist Page With Data

After that, I build a quick About page before moving on to building a checklist page that connects to the data base. 


### Table Of Contents

- [Part 1](/stream-notes-2020-10-06/) - Getting the home page to work
- [Part 2](/stream-notes-2020-10-08/) - Reviewing the first draft and building a model, view, and url structure for a checklist page
- [Part 3](/stream-notes-2020-10-09/) - Learning how to test. And, making a python module so that unittest's output is green instead of red when tests pass. 
- [Part 4](/stream-notes-2020-10-10/) - More progress with testing and getting database content to show up. (Also, updating my local Hugo site to launch into either Sublime Text 2, or Sublime Text 3.)
- [Part 5](/stream-notes-2020-10-10-2/) - Working with forms and getting a pointer to generic views.
- [Part 6](/stream-notes-2020-10-11/) - Review run-through and adding URLs.
