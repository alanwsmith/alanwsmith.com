Use `SERIAL` with `PRIMARY KEY` to create a unique primary key for a table. For example, here's the SQL to make a table with an `id` column as the primary key: 

```sql
CREATE TABLE schema_name.table_name (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    another_column INT
);
```

### Notes

- Using `SERIAL` provides an auto incrementing number up to 2,147,483,647 that takes 4 bytes per row
- There's also `SMALLSERIAL` and `BIGSERIAL` which go up to 32,767 with 2 bytes and 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 with 8 bytes, respectively

###  Further Reading

- You don't need to bother with it unless you're interested in the details, but the different versions of `SERIAL` aren't really types. They're a "notational convenience". Check out [the docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-numeric.html#DATATYPE-SERIAL) if you're interested in the specifics. Otherwise, you can just ignore it.
- Another thing you probably won't have to mess with is an alternate method by making an IDENTITY column. You can't link to it directly but search for `GENERATED { ALWAYS | BY DEFAULT } AS IDENTITY [ ( sequence_options ) ]` on [this page](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html) for details that also tie into [CREATE SEQUENCE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createsequence.html)

Note, if you try to create it with an integer, you'll get something like this as an error:

```
null value in column "id" of relation "example_table" violates not-null constraint
```
