## Lowercase Letters

This code can be used when you only need a sub-set of letters (e.g "a" thru "e"):


```python
letters_lowercase = [chr(c) for c in range(ord('a'), ord('a') + 5 )]

print(letters_lowercase)
```

Outputs:

```
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
```

## Uppercase Letters

```python
letters_lowercase = [chr(c) for c in range(ord('A'), ord('A') + 5 )]

print(letters_lowercase)
```

Which outputs:

```
['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
```


### How It Works - 


Beyond List Comprehensions (which I'm still getting my head around), there are two keys to making this work:

1. `ord()` which turns a character into a number, and
2. `chr()` which turns a number into a character
