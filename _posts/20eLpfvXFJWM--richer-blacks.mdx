This one surprised me. I have been getting some test prints from
online labs to run some comparisons. One company
([MPix](http://www.mpix.com/)) has amoung its offerings the ability
to output onto true black and white paper. I ordered a copy of of
the same black and white print that I had output on color paper
from [whcc](http://www.whcc.com/) on the MPix black and white
paper. Turns out, the color paper has a deeper black and a little
bit better 'pop' to it. My world contines to be turned upside down
by this digitial thing. The print on color paper is a little bit
cooler than the true black and white paper, but it's very slight
and in no way objectionable. And this doesn't even get into the
fact that since it's color paper, most any tone could be applied
easily. So, another vote for whcc.
