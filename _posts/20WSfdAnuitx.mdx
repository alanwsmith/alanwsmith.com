Outside of the boardgame Mousetrap, I can't think of many Rube
Goldberg's that I've seen. Of course there are all the ones that
Wile E. Coyote and other Looney Tunes characters came up with, but
there's something to be said about real life ones
[like these](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3163263343187879320).
After watching this, I've decided that if I ever win the lottery,
one of the ways I'm gonna spend my time is making overly complex
machines to do simple tasks. Fun with kinetic energy.
