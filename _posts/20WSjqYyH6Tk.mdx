Had to set this on the termninal before doing the install for neorocks:

    export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.15
    
If you tried to install it without that, you probably have to uninstall and possible got delete some files (I don't remember the exact details of what I did)

I did not need to do `export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.15` for `lua-cjson`

p.s. I was actually running macOS 11.4 instead of 10.15, but it still worked.
