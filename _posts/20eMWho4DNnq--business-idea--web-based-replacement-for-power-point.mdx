I've been in my fair share of meetings where a Power Point
presentation was the key focus. Even if print outs are provided,
you'll often here attendees asking if the presenter can e-mail them
a copy of the Power Point file. Sometimes the info in the
presentation is enough to stand on its own, but often it falls flat
when taken away from the talking points of the presenter. This got
me thinking about another approach to the display portion of a
presentation that could be called "WebPoints" or something like
that.

The basic idea would be something like this:

-   Instead of using a desktop application like Power Point, a
    browser would be used to create the presentation via a web
    application that provides the same basic layout tools.
-   In addition to the core presentation, talking points and notes
    can be added to each page as well.
-   When the presentation is being given, the talking points would
    be turned off, but when attendees come back to the web app, they
    would have the option to see the notes as well as the main
    presentation pages.
-   There could even be discussion board type functionality built
    in so that there would be an ongoing discussion for each individual
    page or the presentation as a whole.

Other features could include:

-   The ability to export either the presentation, or the
    presentation and its notes to a PDF or other file. Among other
    things, this would ensure that the presentation could be given even
    if it was on a computer without access to the web site.
-   For conference calls, the web site could sync what page is
    being shown to multiple locations. This way the presenter could
    control the display for everyone instead of trying to constantly
    try to ensure everyone is looking at the same page or having to
    install something like WebEx to provide the functionality.

I wouldn't be surprised if there are already services like this out
there, but if there aren't, it is something worth exploring. The
overall setup of a system like this wouldn't require a tremendous
amount of development. The biggest obstacle would be in creating a
nice interface for creating the pages in the web app. Of course, it
could just take images as uploads. Or, better yet, just ingest an
existing Power Point and convert it directly.
