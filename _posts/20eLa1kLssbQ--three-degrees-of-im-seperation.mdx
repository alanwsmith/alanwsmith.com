title: Three degrees of IM seperation
---

AOL has a little page up called [AIMFight](http://aimfight.com/)
that shows you the number of people connected to you through three
degrees of
[buddy list seperation](http://aimfight.com/whatisaimfight.html). I
don't even know what number I would have guessed if asked, but
turns out that I have \~27,000 connections right now. I use it a
lot because of work, but that's insane. Of course, a certain LA
friend has \~53,000 and is in the top 5%. That's a lot of folks...
and I don't really like talking to people unless it's face to face.
Guess I'm in the wrong field for that.
