title: Prevent Command R from Resetting The Terminal Screen in iTerm2

The command+R hotkey in iTerm2 is bound to "Reset" the terminal window in the top level menu. 

I kept hitting it when I thought I was in my browser and was trying to refresh it. The result is it kept clearing nvim which was a pain. 

Luckily, this can be disabled. The fix I used was to go into System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts and then add iTerm2 as an application with a remap of "Reset" to command+8. That overwrites the ability to jump directly to the 8th tab. For some reason neither it or the reset work, but I'm fine with that. 

I just wanted to prevent the reset which is what it does with this in place.
