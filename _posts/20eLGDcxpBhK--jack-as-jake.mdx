ChinaTown - really good.  

The Two Jakes - Not so much. Pretend it doesn't exist. 

It's rare that I stop a movie without watching the whole thing. This one
was a strugle.  

Jack should have convinved Roman Polanski to direct.  

Also saw Cool Hand Luke a few days ago. You should see that if you
haven't already.
