title: Read The Lines Of A File Into A List In Python
slug: 20eOMqHMAybL--read-the-lines-of-a-file-into-a-list-in-python
---

```python3
with open('input.txt', 'r') as _file:
    my_list = _file.read().splitlines()
```
        

I tried to add `.strip()` to the end for extra protection against weird newline stuff, but it didn't work since it's applied to the list and not individual lines. Could do a list comprehension if it really came down to it.
