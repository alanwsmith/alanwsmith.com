title: The Manchurian Candidate - Then and Now

Last night I watched the 2004 version of The Manchurian Candidate.
I've always enjoyed the 1962 version so I was hoping that the
remake was done well. I think the '62 version is a better film, but
they are both very much worth watching. Considering them side by
side really provides an excellent marker of social commentary. I
was expecting the 2004 version to be just and updated filming of
the same story, but that's not the case. There are a few
differences in the overall story line, but they have a dramatic
impact on the overall story arc. The recent version amplifies many
of the current terrorism fears and keys off of them. The '62
version seems a little anachronistic in 2006, but I wonder if it
didn't have the similar societal, psychological link in its day.
