title: Find the problem package that has hacked

This is the way to find the package that was hacked in node. 

```
find . -type f \( -name "package-lock.json" -o -name "yarn.lock" \) -exec grep --color -EHni "ua-parser-js-(0.7.29|0.8.0|1.0.0)" {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

From what I understand, the issue only affected windows, but I haven't confirmed that.
