you want to discover some new music, check out
[KEXP's Song of the Day](http://kexp.org/podcasting/podcasting.asp#song).
I dig the general style of music they push. Combined with the fact
that each "episode" is really an mp3 of a single song, it makes it
one of the best podcasts I've found. As a bonus, they have all
their old stuff up. If you subscribe in iTunes and then hit get
all, you'll receive hundreds of individual songs. Awesome.
