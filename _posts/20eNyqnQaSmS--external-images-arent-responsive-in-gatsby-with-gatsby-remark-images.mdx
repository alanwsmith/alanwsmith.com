title: External Images Arent Responsive In Gatsby With Gatsby Remark Images
slug: >-

Using `gatsby-remark-images` images called from another site weren't responsive for me with:  


            resolve: `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
            options: {
                extensions: ['.mdx', '.md'],
                // a workaround to solve mdx-remark plugin compat issue
                // https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/15486
                plugins: [
                    `gatsby-remark-images`,
                ],
                gatsbyRemarkPlugins: [

                    {
                        resolve: `gatsby-remark-images`,
                        options: {
                            linkImagesToOriginal: false,
                            maxWidth: 800,
                            quality: 82,
                            loading: "eager",
                            disableBgImage: true,
                        },
                    },
                    
                    
                    
                    ... etc...
