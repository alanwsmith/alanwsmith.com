Starting a Wishlist on the blog as single entries. First item in
the new format. A print from the
["Full Moon" exhibit by Michael Light](http://www.michaellight.net/fullmoon/index.html).

This guy got the original negs and chromes from NASA from the Moon
Shots and used the best digital scanner he could get his hands on
to make the highest quality scans he could. There is a book out
called "Full Moon" that's okay, but I got a chance to see a set of
the actual prints hanging at [The Newseum](http://www.newseum.org/)
in D.C. and they are breathtaking.

I don't like the fact that a print cost a little over a grand
because I think the work produced from NASA images should be at
cost. Or, better yet, the scans that were made should be made
available on the NASA web site. Still, I think it would be just
about worth the price to get one of the exhibition quality prints.
