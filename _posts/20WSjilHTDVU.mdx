attempt to call global 'json_decode'

Tried to call `json_decode` in neovim a few different ways. There were some of the errors I got:

    E5108: Error executing lua .../file.lua:##: attempt to call field 'json_decode' (a nil value)
    
    E5108: Error executing lua .../file.lua:##: attempt to call global 'json_decode' (a nil value)
    
The solution was to call it with:

    local json_data = vim.fn.json_decode('{"asdf": "erere"}')
