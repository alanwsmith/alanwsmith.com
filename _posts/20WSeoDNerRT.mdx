As I mentioned before, I've moved over to my own copy of WordPress
for the back end for my blog. This not only give me more control
over the software, but make sure that the content is in my
possession as well. (Okay, so it's really sitting on someone else's
server, but you get the point.) I'm going to keep some notes about
WordPress in the blog itself as a reference and in case anyone else
is interested. The install is very simple. Just upload and unpack
the individual files and then create an empty database that
WordPress can connect to. This should be really simple to do in
just about any hosting package. So far, I'm liking WordPress. Stay
tuned for updates.
