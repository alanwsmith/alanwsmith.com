title: Ideas Topics And Follow Ups For The Podcast
---


Follow ups:

S1:E6 - Main Show

- Worth pointing out that I went back and edited the episodes before 6 as I figured it out (might have talked about that later, so keep an eye out for it)
- About 3 min talk about editing and finding the rightness of the thing in film editing but not in my editing so much. But that's not accurate. Finding the rightness of the thing is what I'm doing with the edits. Paring down to get to the best version
- 

S1:E6 - Aftershow

- Talk about using "that's interesting" as a way to separte from feels a little so you can examine them without being overrun by them

S1:E10 - Main Show

- Talking about mentorship and how videos could be a part of that, but there's still so many out there that there's no guidance intrinsic in them about which one is the most beneficial one to do. 

S1:E11

- Actually talk about the diamond age

0, Sane Defaults - why doesn't the 'wrinkle control' default to on? Probalby an energy saving thing, but for the few seconds it runs every 10 minutes it would be better to have it on by default.
