*NOTE: TODO: This page needs updates to work with MDX*

### Goal: Get tags working on this site √

This was easy... Tags work out of the box with Hugo. The only thing I did was updated the config file to remove the auto generated `categories`. That was done by just adding this to the config.toml file:

```xml{numberLines: true}
[taxonomies]
  tag = "tags"
```

That overwrites the existing `[taxonomies]` which has categories with this option that only contains tags. 


### Goal: Put links to the tag pages on the individual post pages √

This was pretty straight forward with a pull from the documentation. The page where the edit was made for my theme is:

	hugo-site/themes/MY_THEME/layouts/partials/single/title.html

All I had to do was drop this code in:

```xml{numberLines: true}
{{ range $elem_index, $elem_val := (.GetTerms "tags") }}
	{{- if gt $elem_index 0 }}, {{ end -}}
	<a href="{{ .Permalink }}">{{ .LinkTitle }}</a>
{{- end -}}
```	

That code loops through all the tags. If there is more than one, it puts a comma between them. 

### Goal: Put links to the tag pages under the post titles on the index pages √
	
This was pretty much the same as the single page. The pages to edit was:

	hugo-site/themes/MY_THEME/layouts/_default/summary.html

This time the code was:

```xml{numberLines: true}
{{ range $elem_index, $elem_val := (.GetTerms "tags") }}
	{{- if eq $elem_index 0 }} - {{ end -}}
	{{- if gt $elem_index 0 }}, {{ end -}}
	<a href="{{ .Permalink }}">{{ .LinkTitle }}</a>
{{- end -}}
```	

The difference is the line `{{- if eq $elem_index 0 }} - {{ end -}}`. That one prints out a dash before the first tag (if there are any). I use that for a separation from the date that comes in just before it.

I was thinking I'd try to output just the first tag, but after seeing the full list, I'm fine with that. So, this has me in good shape for the tags. 


### Other Stuff

Reference to the different Hugo tokens that can be used in templates:

```html
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>{{/* */}}</td>
		<td>comment</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>{{ }}</td>
		<td>output</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>{{&lt; &gt;}}</td>
		<td>partials</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>{{&#37; &#37;}}</td>
		<td>shortcodes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>{{- -}}</td>
		<td>removes surrounding white space</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>
```
