TODO: Figure out why this isn't working in MDX


For anyone who's ever wondered what a printer error looks like, here you go:

Of course, no internet post about printer errors would be complete with out the Office Space scenes.

I never figured out how to get the printer that created the gobbledigook working. Luckily, there is one other in the office that works for me. If that one dies, I'm going paperless whether I like it or not.
