I had pretty much accepted that it would come sometime in my
lifetime, but Nikon UK, today has announced that it's starting the
phase out of their film bodies. Holy Shit.
> As the film camera market shrinks and the popularity of compact
> digital cameras increases, demand for products that offer advanced
> features and extra value is continuing to grow. High performance
> digital SLR cameras are performing well as users shift from
> film-based SLR cameras or upgrade from compact digital cameras to
> digital SLR cameras. As a result of the new strategy Nikon will
> discontinue production of all lenses for large format cameras and
> enlarging lenses with sales of these products ceasing as soon as
> they run out of stock. This also applies to most of our film camera
> bodies, interchangeable manual focus lenses and related
> accessories. Although Nikon anticipates that the products will
> still be in retail distribution up to Summer 2006. In recognition
> of Nikonâ€™s commitment to professional photographers we will
> continue to manufacturer and sell the F6, our flagship film model,
> as well as a number of manual interchangeable lenses. Sales of the
> manual FM10 will also continue outside Europe.
