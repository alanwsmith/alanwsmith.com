title: Upgrading My Photo Import Script LiveCoding
slug: 20eN8zLl1DMh--upgrading-my-photo-import-script-livecoding
---

This is my first set of live coding sessions. The work I did was to upgrade a script that I use to import photos from my various devices into a specific directory structure and naming convention. It also makes sure not to duplicate images or overwrite any images with the same time stamp. 

The process took a lot longer than I though because I ran into some issues with a broken test. Yet another example of being really glad that I had a test suite in place.
