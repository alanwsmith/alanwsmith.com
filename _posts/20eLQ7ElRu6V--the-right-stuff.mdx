Took it easy tonight and watched [The Right Stuff][1]. I hadn't seen it before even though it was from '83. 

I wish I'd seen it back then.

I thought it was okay, but I didn't really like it that much. A lot of the film had an 80s production feel to it that I just don't like. Also, having just seen [The Aviator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aviator_(2004_film)) a couple weeks ago the standard has been moved up a few rungs. 

I would, however, like to read the book someday (or listen to the audio version). 

The movie did get me thinking though. One thing I'm putting on my list is to make it down to a shuttle launch. It really is amazing that we can put people in space. What's even more amazing is that if technology keeps accelerating the way it has been I might even get a chance to go myself. 

It's fun to imagine a time when space travel is as old hat as airline travel is today. I don't think that's likely to happened for a long time since the choice of destinations is quite limited and likely to remain so for a good while.
