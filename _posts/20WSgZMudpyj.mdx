Regardless of your political affiliation, it would be hard to make
a case against the idea behind
[Recovery.gov](http://recovery.gov/).
> SEC. 1226. RECOVERY.GOV. (a) REQUIREMENT TO ESTABLISH WEBSITE.â€” The
> Board shall establish and maintain a website on the Internet to be
> named Recovery.gov, to foster greater accountability and
> transparency in the use of funds made available in this Act.

Just putting the data out there is one thing, but they also have
the following mandate: "The website shall provide data on relevant
economic, financial, grant, and contract information
**in user-friendly visual presentations** to enhance public
awareness of the use funds made available in this Act." This will
be tremendously helpful if done well. Hearing about spending ones,
tens and hundreds of millions, billions and trillions of dollars is
tough to digest without context. Those amounts always seem like a
lot (and rightly so), but when they are covered in the media it
tends to be an abstract number. A reference point or a comparison
can lead to surprising realizations about how some of the amounts
compare. One of the best examples of this I've seen is the
[Death and Taxes](http://forever.broked.net/~jason/images/Death_and_Taxes_____.jpg)
maps. (That one is from 2004.) The Recovery.gov web site is based
around the bail out money. I hope that it is expanded to cover all
our Tax spending. I, for one, would like to have a better grasp on
where my tax dollars are going.
