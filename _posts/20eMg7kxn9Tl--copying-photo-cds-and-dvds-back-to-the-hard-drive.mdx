I'm in the process of building a single photo archive of all my images. Most of my archive has at least one copy on disk, but there's a fair number from a long time ago that are only on CDs and DVDs.

This is a tedious process. 

1. Load a disk.
2. Open the Finder window for the disk.
3. Make sure that the name of the folders to be moved aren't already being used. 
4. Copy the files. 
5. 



Part of the process it to pull down all the images that are stored only on CDs and DVDs.
