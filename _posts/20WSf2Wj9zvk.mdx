Last year, South by Southwest release about 1.5 Gigs of MP3s from
artist that were playing. One just came up on random that I hadn't
heard before. A song called "Morning Wonder" by
[The Earlies](http://www.theearlies.com/). In another sign that the
net is freaking cool, you can
[check it out for yourself](http://www.theearlies.com/morningwonder-hifi.html).
