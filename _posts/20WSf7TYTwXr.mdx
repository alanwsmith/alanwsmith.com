Listening to the raido this morning there was a story about some
rioting and two times during the story they mentioned "Sending in
troops to restore calm" and "Troops fired into the air to restore
calm". This struck me as very odd, because armed troops flooding
into an area and shooting seems anything but calm inspiring to me.
In the next story there was nother mention, but this broadcaster
phrased it as "Troops were sent in to restore order". That sounds
like a much more plausible outcome. Order, sure. Calm, I don't
know. I think that calm would have to come later, and possibly much
later.
