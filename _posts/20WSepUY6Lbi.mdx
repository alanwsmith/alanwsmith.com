This is the first real post in the new blogging software. I've
moved everything over from the former blogger.com account. I like
the idea of having my stuff be mine and not under someone elses
control. So, I've installed WordPress and am running with it. I've
still got a lot to figure out about it (like how comments work for
other people). Anyways, welcome to the new place.
