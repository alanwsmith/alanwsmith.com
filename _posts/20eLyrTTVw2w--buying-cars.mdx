title: Buying cars
---

A few years ago I checked out from the library one of the Motley
Fool's (http://www.fool.com) books. I think it was
[The Motley Fool You Have More Than You Think : The Foolish Guide To Personal Finance](http://www.amazon.com/Motley-Fool-Have-More-Think/dp/0743201744).
I first heard about The Motley Fool back in probably 1998 or 99. At
that time, they seemed very much about helping consumers make smart
personal finance choices. Now the big thing they seem to do is sell
stock newsletters. This is kinda funny because if memory serves
that's one of the things that they say never to do in the book I
read. They still have what I think is a lot of good info, but it
seems like they want to make a fair chunk of change as well.
Anyway, one of the ideas that I like the best in the book was a
technique they put forward for buying a new car. It turns out, they
have the basic process on their site now too. It's pretty long and
starts [here](http://www.fool.com/car/car.htm). They talk a lot
about research and prep which makes sense but the thing that was
completely new to me is what they get to on
[step 12](http://www.fool.com/car/car12.htm). Basically, instead of
going into a dealership, you send faxes to a bunch of dealerships
asking them to provide a bid for the car you want and provide them
with a fax number to reply to. (I think this comes from the book
which was done in 2001 or so. E-mail is probably just fine these
days, but I'd use a throw away address.) I love this idea. I don't
plan on buying a new car any time soon, but if you do, it's worth
going over the process the Fool's outline to see if you want to
give it a shot. My guess is that it would work like a charm. Not to
mention the basic benefit of having to deal way less with the full
court press sales pitch. Probably goes without saying that you will
still need to be on your toes for all the other little fees and
financing things they will try to get you on.
