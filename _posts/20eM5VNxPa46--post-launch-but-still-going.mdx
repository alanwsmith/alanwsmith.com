title: Post launch but still going
---

We just launched a redesign of PGATOUR.com this Sunday to help
promote the new PGA TOUR Playoffs for the FedExCup. Redesigns are
always exhausting. Unfortunately, we don't get to let up since we
are starting the process for the next one a few weeks ago. That's
right, before the most recent one launched, we were already working
on the next one. Thankfully, it's not usually like this. We made
the current change specifically because it's the first year of the
FedExCup. The trick with this is that we just changed partners at
the start of this year. So, I've basically been working full
throttle since October of last year. Once we get past the next
redesign and to what should be a much more normal working rotation,
I'm seriously thinking about taking a sabbatical.
