If you want to mess with your mind a little, load up this
[flash piece from Nikon](http://www.nikon.co.jp/main/eng/feelnikon/discovery/universcale/index_f.htm)
that puts the size of things in the perspective of orders of
magnitude. It takes a while to load. Also beware that it's set to a
static screen size so make sure you can see the bottom where the
order of magnitude that you can click on to navigate are visible. I
think the part that messed with me the most is when it shows the
size of a carbon nano tube which turns out to be smaller than DNA.
The messages about boundaries in size are interesting, but they
keep showing up which is a little annoying, but it's still amazing
to try to think about the sizes.
