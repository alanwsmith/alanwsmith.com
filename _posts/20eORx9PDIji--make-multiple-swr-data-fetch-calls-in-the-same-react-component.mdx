title: Make Multiple SWR Data Fetch Calls In The Same React Component
slug: 20eORx9PDIji--make-multiple-swr-data-fetch-calls-in-the-same-react-component
---

This code let's you use multiple swr calls in the same component. The key is to apply a name to each one. 


```javascript
const fetcher = (url) => fetch(url).then((res) => res.json())
 
const { data: playlists, error: playlistsError } = useSWR('/api/the-playlists', fetcher)
const { data: songs, error: songsError } = useSWR('/api/the-songs', fetcher)
```


Then you can check for each with:

```
if (playlistsError) return <div>Could not get playlists</div>
if (!playlists) return <div>Loading playlists...</div>
// do something with playlists


if (songsError) return <div>Could not get songs</div>
if (!songs) return <div>Loading songs...</div>
// do something with songs
```

Messing with that is left as an exercise for the reader

Note that the useSWR can't go inside a basic function inside a component
