The theme for today's collection of interesting/useful links is "Time".

1. [When you want see The Time](http://www.time.gov/widget.html) - A little flash clock that tells you the time based off the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the U. S. Naval Observatory (USNO) atomic clocks. *"Readings from the clocks of these agencies contribute to world time, called Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The time maintained by both agencies should never differ by more than 0.0000001 seconds from UTC."*

2. [When you want The Time on your site](http://www.time.gov/widget/) - Embed code for putting the NIST/USNO Time Widget on your own web pages.

3. [Current World Time Map](http://www.worldtimezone.com/) - Easier to use then looking through a list of cities. Note that India and a few other places decided to make their time zone 30min different from just about everyone else. Makes conference call even more of a pain. 

4. [Ubuntu Time Management](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuTime) - The notes for setting and updating the clock on an Ubuntu install. Automatic updates weren't enabled be default on my server install which was surprising.
