(might need `lua-term`)


You need to have nvim_rocks installed, 

before running it, make sure to do:

```
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.15
```

Then, add this to your init.vim file:

```
nvim_rocks.ensure_installed('busted')
```

Like:

  6 lua << EOF
  5 -- require('telescope').load_extension('coc')
  4 require('plugins')
  3
  2 local nvim_rocks = require'nvim_rocks'
  1 nvim_rocks.ensure_installed('lua-cjson')
84  nvim_rocks.ensure_installed('busted')
  1 EOF


Then, just run nvim and it'll try to install

First time didn't work, so you uninstalled it from inside nvim with:

    NvimRocksRemove busted
