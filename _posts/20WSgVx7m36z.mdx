While listening to one of the generic pop stations on the radio
recently, "Our Song" by Taylor Swift came on. I wouldn't have
classified the station I was listening to as "Country" at all, but
I wasn't surprised to hear something in the pop-country genre.
Often the only difference I can tell between regular pop and
pop-country is the accent of the singer and maybe some slide
guitar. In Taylor's case, the accent raises another issue. While
obvious she was attempting to sing with a southern twang, she
struggling mightily with it and ultimately failed to pull it off.
After hearing a song so clearly aimed at the pop-country market
with such an unnatural accent I had couldn't believe she was from
The South. According to everyone's favorite Wikipedia,
[Taylor Swift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift) was born
in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. At age 11, Swift made her first trip
to Nashville, then started to "regularly visit Nashville" at age
14. Seriously? Visiting Nash at 14. Good recording engineers can do
amazing things, but providing a southern accent when you don't have
one doesn't appear to be on the list. If you haven't heard the song
yet, here's a YouTube
