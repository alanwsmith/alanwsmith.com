title: How to Convert a Ruby Array into Hash Keys
slug: 20eN65hwB0qB--how-to-convert-a-ruby-array-into-hash-keys

A current project requires converting an array into a hash. The requirement is simple. The values of the array need to become the keys of the hash. Each key pointing to an empty value until more work is done later in the process. The approach I'm using is to the Ruby Array object's `.collect` method like so:

<%highlight ruby%>
hash = Hash[array.collect { |item| [item, ""] } ]
<%endhighlight%>

It works great. Here's a demo script showing it in action:

<%highlight ruby%>
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'pp'

array = %w(cat hat bat mat)
hash = Hash[array.collect { |item| [item, ""] } ]

pp array
pp hash
<%endhighlight%>

The output of which confirms the hash is created exactly as I need:

<%highlight ruby%>
["cat", "hat", "bat", "mat"]
{"cat"=>"", "hat"=>"", "bat"=>"", "mat"=>""}
<%endhighlight%>

---

Of course, the processing block can assign values as well. For example, changing the above example to use:

<%highlight ruby%>
hash = Hash[array.collect { |item| [item, item.upcase] } ]
<%endhighlight%>

would produce the hash with:

<%highlight ruby %>
{"cat"=>"CAT", "hat"=>"HAT", "bat"=>"BAT", "mat"=>"MAT"}
<%endhighlight%>
