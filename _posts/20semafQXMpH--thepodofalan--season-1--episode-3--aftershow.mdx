Auto-Generated Transcript (I'm in the process of getting this formatted)

00:01
[Music]
00:05
and now we're doing the after show
00:07
welcome to i almost did a hello world
00:09
thing again today um
00:12
but i think i think i'm going to stick
00:14
to not doing that for a while i i think
00:16
it actually makes an okay introduction
00:18
to the things being like hello world
00:19
welcome to this edition of static props
00:22
because that's the word that's in front
00:23
of me right now um because i'm doing
00:24
some coding stuff
00:26
i mean not now but you know in general
00:28
so
00:29
yeah that was i didn't really know where
00:31
that was gonna go i often don't know
00:33
where these are gonna go i just kind of
00:35
you know so behind the scenes stuff
00:39
is i just kind of like
00:41
have an idea to start with and like
00:43
today the idea to start with was just
00:45
that thing of like
00:46
hey um
00:47
i had this tweet it went viral and then
00:49
all of a sudden that turned into all the
00:50
rest of that stuff so it just kind of it
00:53
just kind of goes so to
00:55
for those of you who are new um which
00:58
just probably most of you uh that's just
01:01
kind of the the format here um of how
01:03
these are gonna roll uh i don't i don't
01:06
really come up with a specific idea
01:09
for the big thing i just have something
01:12
that i want to start with and then i
01:14
start and then it just kind of goes
01:16
wherever it goes um
01:18
also so so things the the just kind of
01:20
like some um housekeeping stuff the
01:24
so mental health stuff is definitely
01:26
going to come up um i mentioned the
01:27
other one that like probably wasn't too
01:28
much of that but then it just happened
01:29
so there we go
01:31
i'm not going to not talk about it the
01:33
there are there will be times uh and
01:36
i threw kind of the the warning out
01:38
there
01:39
but just to put the overall warning on
01:41
this for like um
01:43
uh there will be suicidal ideation talk
01:46
in some of these so suicidal trigger
01:47
warnings um i guess content trigger
01:49
warnings i'm still not sure exactly how
01:50
to do that um
01:52
but just as a as a caveat for the whole
01:56
thing you should know that i will i will
01:58
put trigger warnings in front of the
01:59
stuff when i'm about to talk about it um
02:01
explicitly but this is the just kind of
02:03
a heads up fair warning um
02:06
but yeah so
02:08
that was like i kind of like that it's
02:10
really it's it's interesting to me
02:12
like i feel a little bit different doing
02:14
these but not as different as i would
02:15
have thought
02:17
um because in the other ones that i was
02:19
doing in the car
02:20
like i had that action right i was doing
02:22
like i was doing something but here i'm
02:24
not doing anything um i'm i'm not
02:26
driving so it's just kind of sitting
02:28
here and talking but i i also then just
02:30
kind of do the thing where i'm not
02:34
you know it doesn't feel significantly
02:36
different it feels a little bit
02:38
different but not a big jump different
02:39
um
02:40
a couple other housekeeping things so
02:43
uh i will
02:45
i will repeat myself during these uh
02:47
sometimes i may even say different
02:48
things uh of the same topic whatever
02:51
the
02:53
in a bunch of the prior episodes or in
02:55
the bunch of the before time episodes
02:57
uh i i kind of
02:59
struggled with the thing of like oh i'm
03:00
gonna say something over again or i'm
03:02
like like there's a bunch of struggles
03:03
that i went through when i was kind of
03:04
making the the first batch of these
03:07
and some of it was being worried about
03:09
saying the same thing and doing
03:10
repetition or whatever but i have gotten
03:13
to the point where i don't care about
03:14
that um or i'm not or i'm
03:17
it's not i don't care it's that i'm
03:18
unconcerned about
03:20
repeating myself or repeating the same
03:22
topic or repeating whatever because it's
03:24
if if the topic is in the flow of the
03:27
thing
03:27
then it fits and so if whatever i'm
03:30
talking about fits with whatever else
03:32
i'm talking about the fact that i might
03:34
have talked about before talked about it
03:35
before is not
03:37
uh it's not something i'm gonna
03:40
uh fret about to worry about um
03:43
we'll just kind of keep rolling it'll be
03:44
fine so like you will hear repetition of
03:46
the things um that's and like amusingly
03:49
one of the things you'll hear repetition
03:50
about is me
03:51
being concerned
03:53
about being repetitive uh when we
03:56
actually publish the the before times
03:57
ones but i i probably won't bring that
04:00
up too much even though it is still a
04:02
little bit weird like there there are
04:03
parts of this that are weird and there
04:04
are parts of this that are naked feeling
04:06
right
04:07
i
04:08
so i've actually pushed a couple of
04:09
these out now and did the did the sneak
04:12
peek for some friends or whatever and
04:14
like they've listened to them and
04:15
they're like but i'm like all of a
04:17
sudden this has become like a real thing
04:19
and that's
04:21
like it's different like i was nervous
04:23
about doing this today because i was a
04:24
little bit like ah what am i gonna do
04:25
what am i gonna say um
04:28
that was like having that thought was
04:30
not something
04:32
that was in my head for the past year
04:34
doing the before times episodes or the
04:36
car episodes
04:37
because i gotten so used to just doing
04:39
in the car and it was just like the way
04:40
that i was doing it and like they
04:42
weren't out yet so it kind of didn't
04:43
matter et cetera et cetera but now it's
04:45
just like
04:46
yeah this is a thing and like i'm going
04:48
live with it or like it's live um i need
04:51
to i need to actually package it up and
04:52
like push it out so it's like can go on
04:53
your podcast player or your you know
04:55
your podcast app um and actually like
04:57
set up the youtube thing put it on the
04:58
site and all the other things but like
05:00
the episodes are out people have seen
05:01
them so
05:03
we're live um but yeah so
05:07
i don't know i think that'll probably
05:09
wrap it this will be a short out this
05:10
will be a short after show um which will
05:12
happen sometimes you know they can be
05:14
long they can be not they can be
05:16
something there's a song that's like
05:17
that i can't remember what it is
05:20
what is that song
05:22
oh no it's the uh it's the ryan reynolds
05:24
and wolf arrow thing uh from tiktok
05:27
that you can be purple you can be blue
05:29
you can be whatever and whatever i'm not
05:31
gonna sing it um because that is not a
05:33
skill that i have
05:35
um
05:36
acquired or gained or just to have
05:39
period
05:40
but yeah so that'll do it i appreciate
05:41
