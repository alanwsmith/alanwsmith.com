I like avoiding putting passwords in cleartext. So, I use my computer's assword manager. 

To keep things simple when dealing with credentials I make a folder at the top of my projected called `credentials` then put in a file called `database.js` that looks something like:

TKTKTKT

I use it in my api pages by putting this at the top:

```
import { getSession } from 'next-auth/client'
```

Then using the function like this:

```
console.log(db_user())
```

works great
