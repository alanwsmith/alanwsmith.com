If you haven't seen [Pandora](http://pandora.com/) and you are a
fan of music, go there now. It's a way to create online "radio"
stations by choosing some songs/artists you like and then it drops
in similar stuff along with it. You can listen for a few songs
without signing up, but it's worth it to register an account (it's
free, but requires e-mail address). A while ago I was thinking
about creating a music recommender site, but mine wasn't going to
stream music, and I don't think there is anyway I could have come
near this which uses
[The Music Genome Project](http://pandora.com/mgp.shtml) for its
backend. Kudos to the folks who pulled this off. Yet anothe fine
example of a way the internet can broaden your world and help you
find new things that are your style.
