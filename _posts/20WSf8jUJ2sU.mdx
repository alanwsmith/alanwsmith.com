I think my cell phone can see the future and is possessed my a
gremlin. The batter ran all the way down last night for probably
the first time since I've had the phone. So, I plugged it back in
before I went to bed, but when I did, I didn't turn it back on.
Then, early this morning (before I get up on Sundays) we had a
problem with the site and I got the call (even though this
particular call should have gone to someone else). I get up a
couple hours later and have 6 messages as soon as I turn the phone
on.... I haven't gotten a weekend emergency call in months and I
really am not sure if my cell phone has been down in years. So, of
course, those two things happen in the same 12 hour period and make
me look like a bit of an ass.
