Details on strftime
===================

From the bottom: use `-` to remove leading zeros (e.g. `%-I` to get the hour from a 12 hour clock without leading zeros)





This is what the bash command line "date" tool uses for formatting.

%A - replaced by national representation of the full weekday name.

%a - replaced by national representation of the abbreviated weekday name.

%B - replaced by national representation of the full month name.

%b - replaced by national representation of the abbreviated month name. (%h does the same thing)

%C - replaced by (year / 100) as decimal number; single digits are preceded by a zero.

%c - replaced by national representation of time and date.

%D - equivalent to ``%m/%d/%y''.

%d - replaced by the day of the month as a decimal number (01-31).

%E* %O* - POSIX locale extensions.  The sequences %Ec %EC %Ex %EX %Ey %EY %Od %Oe %OH %OI %Om %OM %OS %Ou %OU %OV %Ow %OW %Oy are supposed to provide alternate representations. Additionally %OB implemented to represent alternative months names (used standalone, without day mentioned).

%e - replaced by the day of the month as a decimal number (1-31); single digits are preceded by a blank.

%F - equivalent to ``%Y-%m-%d''.

%G - replaced by a year as a decimal number with century.  This year is the one that contains the greater part of the week (Monday as the first day of the week).

%g - replaced by the same year as in ``%G'', but as a decimal number without century (00-99).

%H - replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (00-23).

%I - replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (01-12).

%j - replaced by the day of the year as a decimal number (001-366).

%k - replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (0-23); single digits are preceded by a blank.

%l - replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (1-12); single digits are preceded by a blank.

%M - replaced by the minute as a decimal number (00-59).

%m - replaced by the month as a decimal number (01-12).

%n - replaced by a newline.

%O* - the same as %E*.

%p - replaced by national representation of either "ante meridiem" (a.m.)  or "post meridiem" (p.m.)  as appropriate.

%R - equivalent to ``%H:%M''.

%r - equivalent to ``%I:%M:%S %p''.

%S - replaced by the second as a decimal number (00-60).

%s - replaced by the number of seconds since the Epoch, UTC (see mktime(3)).

%T - equivalent to ``%H:%M:%S''.

%t - replaced by a tab.

%U - replaced by the week number of the year (Sunday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (00-53).

%u - replaced by the weekday (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (1-7).

%V - replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (01-53).  If the week containing January 1 has four or more days in the new year, then it is week 1; otherwise it is the last week of the previous year, and the next week is week 1.

%v - equivalent to ``%e-%b-%Y''.

%W - replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (00-53).

%w - replaced by the weekday (Sunday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (0-6).

%X - replaced by national representation of the time.

%x - replaced by national representation of the date.

%Y - replaced by the year with century as a decimal number.

%y - replaced by the year without century as a decimal number (00-99).

%Z - replaced by the time zone name.

%z - replaced by the time zone offset from UTC; a leading plus sign stands for east of UTC, a minus sign for west of UTC, hours and minutes follow with two digits each and no delimiter between them (common form for RFC 822 date headers).

%+ - replaced by national representation of the date and time (the format is similar to that produced by date(1)).

%-* - GNU libc extension.  Do not do any padding when performing numeri- cal outputs.

%_* - GNU libc extension.  Explicitly specify space for padding.

%0* - GNU libc extension.  Explicitly specify zero for padding.

%% - replaced by `%'.
