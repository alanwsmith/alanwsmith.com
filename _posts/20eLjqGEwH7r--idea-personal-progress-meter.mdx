title: Idea Personal Progress Meter
---

I've never been a particularly "Goal Driven" person. I just go
where the wind takes me, but recently I've been making some
specific short and long term goals. This got me thinking about what
would be a good way to keep track of them. I know there are sites
like 43Things to help you with this, but I'd rather keep my stuff
private. So, the idea is this. Create a web site (perhaps
PersonalProgressMeter.com) where individuals can input their goals.
The real trick, though is to keep track of your progress easily.
So, to accomplish this each goal would have a "daily", "weekly" or
"monthly" flag. Check-up emails would be sent on each on of those
intervals with a list of the corresponding goals. Ideally, the
eMail would be HTML based and contain a form that asked the
question, "did you get closer to this goal?" with a set of yes/no
check boxes. The individual would go through and click the
appropriate one and submit the form to keep track. Of course, I'm
not sure if forms work in HTML email, so that would have to be
determined. If not, there is probalby some way to do it to make it
simple and quick which would be fairly critical. Anyway, it would
at least help keep your goals in the front of your mind.
