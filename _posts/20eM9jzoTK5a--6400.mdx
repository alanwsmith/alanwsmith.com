Was just looking around a little at Nikon's new D3. If you are a photographer and you haven't seen the sample images on [this page](http://press.nikonusa.com/2007/09/nikon_d3_sample_images.php), you really should look. The images shot at 6400 ISO are amazing. 

If you are looking for an example of where digital beats film, those images are it. Boggles the mind a little to think what sensors will be like in five year increments from this point forward. My Canon 5D does what used to be great with higher ISO shots, but the bar has definitely been moved up a few notches.
