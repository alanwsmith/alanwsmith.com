If you are a fan of the SEC and own an iPhone or an iPod Touch,
you'll want the free
"[SEC Football Pocket Schedule](http://www.silvertree.com/pages.aspx?id=6)"
from [SilverTree Technology](http://www.silvertree.com/). (They
also have a Big 12 one if you're into that.)

Interestingly, once I move off that page on their site, I can't see
any other links back to it. Whatever the case, the App itself works
as a great add for the company. I never would have seen their site
if I hadn't started with the app. The app itself is pretty simple,
but it's really well designed, loads fast and is intuitive. So, not
only is it a free ad for them, it lets potential clients know that
they do good work.
