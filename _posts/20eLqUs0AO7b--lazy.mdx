I've been being lazy with my blog or late. A bunch of stuff picked
up at work and I've been trying to get a bunch of other things in
life in order and I just haven't written anything. This is kinda
the way I am though. A little bit bi-polar when it comes to things.
I get focused on something and do it a lot, then move away from it
for a while. Anyways, there should be some more posting soon. I
still need to get my write up of the Infrared done, and get the
full photo galley posted. I'm, once again, building my own web
gallery template/system which is also holding up the process. Even
though there are a ton of ways out there that I could pull one off
the shelf and have saved a ton of time and already had everything
posted they don't work EXACTLY the way I want. They are probalby
80-90%, but for what I want, the real refinement of that last
10-20% is important to me. Plus, I get a lot of enjoyment out of
building the system.
