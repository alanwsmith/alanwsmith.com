title: Killing the IE Clicking Sound
type: post

I use Mozilla FireFox most of the time, but have to check stuff I'm
working on in IE (since it has the vast majority of the market
place). One thing that has alwasy bugged me is the "click" sound
you get every time you go to a new page, or a page refreshes.
Someone just told me the way to kill the sound. This works in
Windows XP at least, but it may be the same for other Windows
machines. - Under your "Start" menu, select "Settings" then
"Control Panels". -Â  Choose the "Sounds and Audio Devices" control
panel and open it up. -Â  Select the "Sounds" tab inside the
control panel. - In the "Program Events" scorlling window, Find the
"Start Navigation" element under "Windows Explorer" and change it
sound to "None". You know, because, that was easy to find.....
