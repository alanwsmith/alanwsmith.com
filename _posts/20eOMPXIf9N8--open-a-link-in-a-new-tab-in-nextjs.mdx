<Link href={someUrl}>
    <a target="_blank">Text For The Link</a>
</Link>
```




See this answer from here:


Simply put your navigation code inside an anchor with _blank as target (i.e: <a herf={`/product-details/${product.id}`} target="_blank">).

Using Link component here provides no performance benefit to the end user since you're requesting a fresh load of your site on a new browser tab.
