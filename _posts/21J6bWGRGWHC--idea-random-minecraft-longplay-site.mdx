title: 'Idea: Random Minecraft Longplay Site'
---

single site that just playes minecraft a randome long play minecraft video from a loop. 

this would be one where you could start in the middle based of a random time. Just make sure there is at least an hour left. 

The idea would be to get enough that someone was unlikely to see the same one (or part of it)
