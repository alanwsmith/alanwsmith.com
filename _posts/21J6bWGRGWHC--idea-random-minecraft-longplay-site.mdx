title: 'Idea: Random Minecraft Longplay Site'
---

- single page site that just plays random long play minecraft videos
- this would be one where you could start in the middle based of a random time (so you don't always start at the beginning, but I guess if there's enough of them that wouldn't matter as much). Just make sure there is at least an hour left. 
- The idea would be to get enough that someone was unlikely to see the same one (or part of it)
- Another feature would be add add music like this to is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvM9AfAzoSo - just have a separate player
