This is more a note for myself so that I can find it later. But if
you ever want to see more about what's going on when your web
browser pulls pages over the internet you can use a few Firefox
extensions to gain a lot of insight. Key ones to use are:
-   [FireBug](http://www.getfirebug.com/) - edit, debug, and
    monitor CSS, HTML, and JavaScript
-   [Web Developer Toolbar](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60)
    - Adds a menu and a toolbar with various web developer tools.
-   [YSlow](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/) - Add on for FireBug
    that adds more reporting about how the page is performing.

There is an
[article](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-jstools/)
at IBM Developworks that has some info about a two of those and
GreaseMonkey. It's worth reading as well.
