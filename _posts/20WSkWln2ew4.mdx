mkdir some-app-name
cd some-app-name
npx create-next-app .

    netlify dev

If you're not using netlify, you can do:

  npm run dev
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Builds the app for production.

  npm start
    Runs the built app in production mode.

Notes for Netlify CLI setup:

- Create github repo
- Clone the repo down locally
- Put in your .gitignore
