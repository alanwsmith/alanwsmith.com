title: Beautiful Slow Motion Footage of a Shuttle Launch
---

```
TODO: Figure out why this isn't working in MDX

Some folks at NASA got together and put together a video with footage from various high-speed cameras that are used to film a launch. Gets points for being both interesting and beautiful. Fair Warning: The first one is 45 min long and you might watch the entire thing without meaning to. I figured I'd watch a few minutes of it, but got absorbed and stopped noticing time until it ended.

And here's a second clip with bonus footage that they couldn't get in the first one become of time constraints.
