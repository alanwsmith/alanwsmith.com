The past two Halloweens I've shot for a costume that I could
incorporate my "real" camera into. Two years ago, I was a playboy
photographer. Photo Vest, big camera, and a laminated ID badge.
This year, I was peter parker. Thick glasses frames, big camera,
dress shirt opened a little to reveal the top of the spiderman
outfit I was wearing under it, and an ID badge. I just saw what I
want to go as next year.
