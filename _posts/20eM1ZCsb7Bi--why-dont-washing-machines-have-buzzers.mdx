title: Why dont washing machines have buzzers
---

Just about ever dryer I've seen has one, but the washing machines
don't. Best thing I can come up with is "they" figure you will hear
the washing machine stop after the spin cycle. More often than not,
this isn't the case for me. So, my clothes sit there wadded up in
the washing machine until I remember to check which is usually an
hour or so after it's stopped. Occasionally, it's the following
day. Guess I need to get a little timer stick to it and set each
time, but this is one of those things that seems like it should
have been addressed a long time ago. Weird.
