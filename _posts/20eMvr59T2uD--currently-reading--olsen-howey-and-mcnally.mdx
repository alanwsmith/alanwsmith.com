title: Currently Reading - Olsen Howey and McNally
---

The initial reading list for a week off includes three favorite topics: Programming, Sci-Fi and Photography. (Also, Culture.)

- [The Culture Code: An Ingenious Way to Understand Why People Around the World Live and Buy as They Do][cc] by Clotaire Rapaille - Heard about this one on some podcast. Seemed interesting. So, it's the current audiobook. Because the title is designed for Search Engine Optimization, no other description is necessary.
- [Design Patterns in Ruby][dpr] by Russ Olsen - I've been picking up a little of the Ruby language over the past year. Would have done more except for a giant transition project at work that ate up most of my time. Hitting it harder now. Since actually reading a Design Patterns book is also on my list, this looks perfect. 
- [Shift (Silo Saga - Volume 2)][silo] by Hugh Howey - The follow up to Wool which I read last year and really enjoyed. If you have a Kindle, you can read the first of the five parts of Wool free [here][wool]. When you're done, pick up the Omnibus. It's a fun ride. It's also an example of success in self-publishing. 
- [Sketching Light: An Illustrated Tour of the Possibilities of Flash][sl] by Joe McNally - Photography is the art of lighting. Mr. McNally is a master at the craft. There is always something new to learn from him.
