title: Not so much with the infrared

It would have been too easy. I'm trying to do some infrared flash
photography. The attempt was to take a piece of slide film that had
been developed before it was exposed (so that it was black) and
tape it over a strobe. The idea being that slide film is supposed
to transmit infrared even if the film is totally black.

The problem, it would seem, is that the camera I'm shooting with (a
Canon 10D) has an internal filter that effectively blocks the
infrared portion of the spectrum from reaching the sensor. So, no
go there.

What I'm trying to do is get a setup where I can shoot bands with a
strobe setup without having to gun them in the face with a blast of
light every time I fire off a shot. If money were no object, I'd
just get one of these modded cameras that has a clear filter
instead of the blocking on:

Guess I'll have to make do with either available light or letting
the strobe loose.
