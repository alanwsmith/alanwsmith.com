I've heard one of the reasons you see skulls in old paintings so
often is that artists used to keep one around as a reminder of
their mortality. This seems like a good idea to me. Following along
the line of making sure that you live every day to its fullest and
to try not to let the little things get to you. So, I went in
search of a skull. They are really cheap these days. Like under
$10.

The one I ended up with is
[this one](http://tr.im/h8YB "Grinning Skull"). It's very well
detailed but a little smaller than I expected. No big deal, I
really like it. The funniest part of the shopping experience to me
was where Amazon had the skull categorized: Home and Garden. Here's
a grab of the search results.

I'm not sure where I would have expected it, but Home and Garden
would have been way down on my list of guesses. I'm not a big
shopper of that department, but I'll have to browse around a little
to see what other interesting surprises are there.
