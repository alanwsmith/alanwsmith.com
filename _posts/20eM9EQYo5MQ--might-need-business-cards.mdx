title: Might need business cards
---

I've been doing a lot of thinking about getting back into weddings
again. This is a topic I flip-flop on a lot. I won't be able to
really do anything about it till we get past the new year due to
the amount of stuff going on at work. After that though, I think
I'm going to take a run at it again. The digital thing is a big
factor and another is Adobe lightroom. After using it a little, I
think it's a great way to run the preliminary wedding edit. The
first wedding that I did all digital, I was using Photoshop and
Bridge on my old ass computer and it took forever. While the
process itself is decently time consuming, the real issue I had was
the amount of time that I was waiting on the computer. I'll get
around to building a new computer before too long. If I haven't
done it before my next wedding, I'll definitely do it at that point
just to make sure I can get thru the edits in a reasonable time.
Anyway, about the business cards. I went to a Halloween party last
night as Peter Parker. The reason for picking that character was so
that I could fit my camera in as part of the costume. Did the same
thing last year when I went as a Playboy photographer. It's great
because for a while no ones sure if you are really taking photos or
if you are just pretending as part of the costume. After it became
fairly obvious that I really was shooting, I talked to two couples
about shooting their weddings and a couple other folks about some
photography in general. All of them, of course, asked for cards.
So, I guess it's time to get some made up.
