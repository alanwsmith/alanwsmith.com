title: My First Internet Video Post
---

I'm a stills guy. Not a video guy. It took me over a year with my latest point and shoot to actually think about the fact that it has video and to give it a try. Even longer to get the first real clip shot and posted. Today is the day. Here is my first video internet post.

This is the tail end of the crowd leaving Bryant-Denny after the 2008 Iron Bowl where the Tide beat the stew outta Auburn. Final score, a 36-0 shutout. Watching the fans move at roughly the same speed across caught my eye and I decided it would make a worthy video. This was after most of the fans had already filed out. Next time I'm there, I'll see if I can get on the ramp earlier and see what it looks like with more people packed together.
