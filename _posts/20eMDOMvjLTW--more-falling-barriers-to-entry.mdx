title: More falling barriers to entry
---

I had a really good conversation with some friends over the little
holiday I had talking about the barrier to entry into certain
professions. One of the biggest ones that I've seen personally is
with photographers. With very inexpensive gear that produces pretty
amazing results and the fact that film and processing is no longer
required, it seems that the number of people in the photographic
world on both the amateur and professional sides. I mentioned again
that I used to carry a film point and shoot to the bars with me. I
used to be the only one with a camera. If you discount cell phone
cameras (which mostly don't have a flash that's required to shoot
most bars), there still seems to be at least one or two cameras in
every group of people. Photography, music, video are three things
that I know of that the barrier to entry has been dramatically
lowered. Of course, within each of the disciplines what really
matters is the piece you produce. Check out this "making-of" video
of some folks who have a little gear and a ton of ability.
