A few weeks ago, I made a post<sup>1</sup> on how it's been drought-level-dry in my neck of the woods. Apparently, that's the modern day equivalent of a rain dance. The skies opened up and we've been getting drenched (including a bout of precipitation from a tropical storm) every day since.

For a visual aid in the earlier post, I shot some photos of the little pond in my back yard. Here's the original photo from May 21st.

Here's a shot from roughly the same place taken today (June 14th).

I don't know how deep the pond is, but it wouldn't surprise me if the volume of water has doubled between the shots. For another comparison, check the water level at the overflow drain.

Before:

After:

I couldn't shoot that one from the same location. I would have had to have been chest deep in the water.
