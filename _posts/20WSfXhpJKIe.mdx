I forgot how to pronouce the word "Quixotic" and was asking an
office mate if he knew, but he didn't. Turning to the magic of the
net I pulled up Merriam-Webster's site and looked up the word:
http://m-w.com/dictionary/quixotic Among other useful things, there
is a little speaker button beside the word that you can click on to
get an audio clip of the word being pronounced. Very cool reminder
that we have come a long way since Moveable type was first
invented.
