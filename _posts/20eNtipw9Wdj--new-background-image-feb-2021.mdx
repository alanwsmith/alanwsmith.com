title: New Background Image Feb 2021
---

I've been playing with the design of the site. I like the white notecard look, but couldn't get a background color that I liked to work with it. Finally figured out that what I wanted is a breakup pattern. Searching around for background images I found this free one from a person named Yongja Kim: [Dust & Scratches](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/dust-scratches/)

I love it.
