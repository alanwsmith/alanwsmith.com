Continuing to count down to the Crimson Tide season kickoff with elephants my mom has given me over the years. 

Another change in the lighting. This little guy is sitting on a piece of foam core board. There is a bare flash behind and a little above and then a side flash that's flagged off so that it only illuminates his head and ear. 

Roll Tide, y'all.
