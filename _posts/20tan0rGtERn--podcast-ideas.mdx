Some possible topics for the podcast to get things started.

```
export const data =`
0, Music that saved my life - the radio station commercial that got you.
1, Talk about editing - how I was thinking I wouldn't edit, and when I watched some I was fine with that, but when I just listened to it it changed my mind
0, Making notes of topics - not something I did before - feels a little like cheating somehow, but it's really just the evolution of the thing
0, Moving to 4K even though that doesn't matter now. 
0, The coffee maker at the office where one button you have to hold and the other you have to press stop. 
0, My notecards and collecting notes
0, Not having ideas like I used to (in the before days, I could have ripped off twenty things here in no time, but I'm not coming up with much right now.. though, it is late...)
0, Our identity as we get older and even now. What "are we" - https://twitter.com/THEANTHEMGIRL/status/1459415749378953218
0, Developer Advocite metrics article to read: https://theworst.dev/developer-advocates-guide-to-metrics-and-reporting
0, Trying not to be "that guy" - https://twitter.com/ChloeCondon/status/1459940932267102212
0, The Hub Initiative - Personal sites/hubs with control of the content and links and comments and access
0, Buying an expensive mac and expensive tools in general
0, Success iceburg graphic - https://twitter.com/lauragift_/status/1460262133359329283 - note that it's missing luck.
0, Vanity Metrics - vs. dollars. Since I'm not after dollars, they are all vanity and that's fine (even though I'm not really tracking them at the moment. I go for months at a time without looking at my analytics)
0, Usability like gmail where when you mouse over the inbox it raises the chat window so it's under your cursor
0, Talk about the idea of a covers streaming service that gets blanket mechanical licenses
0, Bands playing the same sone for 20 years. Dave Matthews in parcicular since you saw him as the first show at bama
