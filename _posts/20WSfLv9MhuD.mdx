Today I shot my first completely digital wedding. I'm still shaking
my head a little in disbelief. I'm on my second digital camera
body, and have been quite pleased with it, but haven't really done
much of anything professionally with it till today. I used to shoot
weddings with a Hasselblad 500 C/M. That camera is completely
mechanical and doesn't even have a battery. I'd use a handheld
meter for exposure readings and an external flash that had its own
sensor. I didn't have any 220 backs for the camera, just 120 so I
would have to reload film every 12 shots. To contrast that with the
5D which has auto-focus that is faster than I could ever be with
built in metering that's tied directly into the flash and 4GB
memory cards that can hold \~250 shots. I know it's been said
before, but offloading a lot of the more mechanical parts of an
exposure to the technology really does make it easier to focus on
the image. I've know this conceptually for a long time and have had
some practical experience with it, but shooting a wedding REALLY
made the contrast stand out for me. So, this is the future, huh?
I'm liking it. An added bonus: I get to make lots of "Back when I
was a young photographer..." comments.
