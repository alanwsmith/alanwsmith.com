This has been a long ass day. Went to bed about two this morning
(because I'm a night owl). Then, got up at a little after 4am, left
the house at 4:45am and drove to the airport to catch a 6:20am
flight to Atlanta. Spent all day at our partners offices up there
(mostly in meetings) and then flew back to Jax. Made it to my house
about 11:45pm. While it's nice to not have to pack an overnight
bag, I think I would prefer that to this type of run. As for now,
going to read for a few min to wind down then drop off to sleep
pretty darn quickly.
