Sitting in the Austin Public Library right now using their free wireless. I love free wireless. There is a lot that is very cool about the internet. Having the ability to access it for free is way up there on the list of coolness.  

Food for thought: one could actually run an internet based business out of a library. Here's to hoping that the big corporations don't kill off city-wide free Wi-Fi. They are certainly going to try.
