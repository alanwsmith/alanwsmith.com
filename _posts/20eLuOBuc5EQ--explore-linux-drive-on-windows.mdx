If you ever have a linux drive that you need to look at on a
windows machine (say, one that is attached via a USB external
enclosure, a tool named
[explore2fs](http://www.chrysocome.net/explore2fs) will get you
there. It appears to be open source. There is no install, it's just
an .exe that you launch and you can view linux volumes.
