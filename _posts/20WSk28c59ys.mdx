TODO: Run these samples to verify they work as expected


This is what I'm using when I don't want to make a full module for python. It keeps all the files in the same directory which isn't wonderful from a tidyness perspective, but it's fine. The other option is to setup a `tests` directory, but that requires jumping through some more hoops. 

NOTE: Another way I'm doing this is to name the test files `x01_whatever.py` then switching the run call to `x*.py`. This makes tab completition a little easier.


### ./run_tests.bash

```command
#!/bin/bash

python -m unittest discover -s . -p '*_test.py'
```

### ./test_01_basic_example.py

NOTE: This file cannot start with a number

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python 

from charlie_snake import SnakeControl

class SnakeControlTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        global sc 
        sc = SnakeControl()

    def test_equality(self):
        expected = True
        result = sc.example_method()
        self.assertEqual(expected, result)
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### ./charlie_snake.py

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

class SnakeControl():
    def example_method(self):
        return True
```
