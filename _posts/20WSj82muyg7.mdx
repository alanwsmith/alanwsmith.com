Everthing changed.      

Or, really, I changed everything. 
`
I'm writing this on my new [Moonlander keyboard. It's a while ride. A split keyboard at its base with different positions thrown in for fun. 

I've been using it for a few hours now and I think I've mostly got a handle on the basics. At least, the basics of writing prose. Code is a whole 'nother thing that I expect to be an adventure.

The bigger change is that I'm writing this on a Windows machine. After something like 30 years working on Macs, I'm giving it a go. 

I want to make [ThisIsHowToCode.com](https://thisishowtocode.com/
) as accessible as possible for new comers. There are way more folks on Windowds and the machines are way less expensive. So, I'm going to mee the masses on their platform.

The good news is that the transition hasn't been as rocky as I was afraid it might have been. Turns out that all the windows machines I used before were under-powered. I bought the parts for mine off a gamer who was upgrading. So, there pretty solid. That makes all the differnece in the world. 

Now, I just have to figure out how to code on this keyboard.
