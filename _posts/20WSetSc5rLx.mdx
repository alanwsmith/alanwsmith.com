I like the idea of being a "Cool Hunter". Especially when it comes
to technology. I just checked and  
techcoolhunter.com  
is available. Add that to the list of things I might play with if I
didn't have a day job. If someone is looking to start a tech blog,
that would be a great domain to launch it from.
