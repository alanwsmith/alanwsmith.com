Mr. Nuge
[made himself a little pin hole out of cardboard](http://nugeworthy.blogspot.com/2005/10/pinhole-slr.html).
This got me thinking about something I tried back in the days of
film. Making a lens cap into a pin hole "lens" with a piece of
aluminum foil. So, here's my test shot:

This is looking out my back porch at very close to sunset. Exposure
was about 8 seconds. Needed to be a little more. I think the fact
that there was no aperture may have confused the meter. I'll try a
few more tomorrow with some stronger light to see what shakes
out.  
Definitely the cheapest "lens" I've ever shot with. For film based
pin hole, I've always wanted to give
[one of these](http://www.pinholecamera.com/hardwoods.html) a
try..
