title: Read And Write To Buffer
slug: 20eO4cHtpMMm--read-and-write-to-buffer
---

This reads from a buffer and writes back to it a couple lines down (it's a little weird, but it mostly works
)

    local_lines = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(0, 0, 1, false)
    
And if you want to pull in the first line, do this:


    first_line = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(0, 0, 1, false)[1]
