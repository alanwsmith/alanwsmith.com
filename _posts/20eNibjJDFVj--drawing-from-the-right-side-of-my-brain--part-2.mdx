  This is the progress I made in a single week. It's amazing. (And, everyone did
  the same quality. It's the course, not the people.)

Here, again, is the initial self-portrait from the first day of class.

And here, to my amazement, is what I was able to make at the end.

As before, everyone in the class produced art of roughly the same quality. Mine was again middle of the pack and again not far from the worst or the best. 

I never thought I could draw. Even more, I told and convinced myself I couldn't. I thought it was magic some folks had that most of us didn't. I couldn't have been more wrong. It's a skill and skills can be taught. I'd always heard that, but never *really* believed it. Now, I absolutely do.

_P.S. Please forgive the dower expression. The portrait is done looking in a mirror and we were told to keep a neutral expression so we didn't have to hold a smile. Given that it took four hours, that was good advice._
