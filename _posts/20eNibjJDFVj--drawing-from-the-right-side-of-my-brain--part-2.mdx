  This is the progress I made in a single week. It's amazing. (And, everyone did
  the same quality. It's the course, not the people.)

title: Drawing From the Right Side of My Brain  Part 2

Here, again, is the initial self-portrait from the first day of class.

alt="The initial self-portrait drawing I made in the Drawing On The Right Side Of The Brain course. It's not particularly good in ways that I can't really describe." />

And here, to my amazement, is what I was able to make at the end.

<Img src="drawing_on_the_right_side_of_the_brain_final_portrait.jpg" alt="The self-portrait I drew at the end of the Drawing On The Right Side Of The Brain course. It's way better. There's shading and shadow and my eyes are in the right place and my nose looks like a nose." />


As before, everyone in the class produced art of roughly the same quality. Mine was again middle of the pack and again not far from the worst or the best. 

I never thought I could draw. Even more, I told and convinced myself I couldn't. I thought it was magic some folks had that most of us didn't. I couldn't have been more wrong. It's a skill and skills can be taught. I'd always heard that, but never *really* believed it. Now, I absolutely do.

_P.S. Please forgive the dower expression. The portrait is done looking in a mirror and we were told to keep a neutral expression so we didn't have to hold a smile. Given that it took four hours, that was good advice._
