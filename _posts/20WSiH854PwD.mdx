title: The Morning Ritual and Maybe Getting an AWS Person to Stream With Me
type: post
---

Welp. I didn't journal yesterday. 

I got up and started messing around on the computer. Before I knew it, I completely forgot to journal. I did a car vlog yesterday and remembered it when I was driving, but forgot again when I got home. 

That's what happens when I skip the morning ritual. It wasn't even intentional. I don't remember what I did, but it was one of those "I'll just take care of something real quick" before writing things. Then, I got sucked into doing and doing and doing.

I almost did the same thing this morning, but managed to get back to the journal. What I did was start an archive process that's backing up my photo archive to [Amazon's S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). I use the [aws command line](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) tool for the backup. In the past, I've used an account with [Multi-Factor Authentication](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/mfa/) on it which means it quits working after a day when the token expires. It also meant that it would stop working if I need to use another account for work or my stream. Yesterday, I fixed that. I've got the account setup as its own profile. It now runs independently of the other processes. 

The other interesting thing that's going on is that I might be getting an Amazon person to join me on the steam. One of my contacts was helping me with a project last week. I mentioned I stream and would love to get him on to show me how to use various AWS tools. He loved the idea. I was drifting in and out of sleep all night last night thinking about it. (The good news is taht I didn't wake up at 3am and start writing up notes about it which would have been a sign I was ramping into a bipolar mania.)

The guys name is Chris, so I'm thinking we'd call the episodes "Coding with Chris". We could start by building a web site to host the episodes. Showing how to setup [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) and [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) and maybe an [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance to house [Hugo](). (Still gotta think about that last part to see if it's worth it. Might be interesting to do it on a Workspace)

We could make YouTube deployers, a mailing list (or connection to a mailing list service, probably). Twitter bots, something with [Internet Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html) and [Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/), and just generally use the AWS services.

I'm really digging the idea. 

Could get some legit traffic too.
