Well, the new camera came in today. I walked out on the course and took a few shots with it. Here is, literally, the first shot from the camera after it left the factory:

![Number 17 - TPC Sawgrass - First shot](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/20060316_053438a.jpg "Number 17 - TPC Sawgrass - First shot")

First impressions, I'm very impressed with the camera. It feels right, and going back to a "full-frame" camera where wide angles are actually wide again is awesome.

Incidentally, here is a 100% clip from the above image. It's a little compresses so it's not representative of the full image quality, but it's still pretty good.

Only thing that is ticking me off right now is that it looks like Adobe has only released a RAW converter for CS2 and hasn't updated the one for regular old CS. That's a shitting way for a company to try to get people to upgrade and doesn't strike me as the type of thing I would have expected from Adobe.
