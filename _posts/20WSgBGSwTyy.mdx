I'm notorious for taking forever to get my photos in a state where
people can see them. In the old days, this meant that I had a lot
of film that it would take me forever to develop. (Okay, it's still
those days now since I have a lot that I
[still haven't developed](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/2006/01/25/unprocessed-film/).)
These days, in my digital shooting world, it means I take forever
to get things either A) downloaded off the camera/cards or B) get
them posted on a site so someone can see them. I got a new point
and shoot camera a while back with a 2GB card. I'm not sure how
many photos it would take to fill, but it's a lot. Probably
800-900. This camera has a different size memory card than my other
ones so I was planning to just use the USB cable to pull them off
in the sort term. After I took the camera out of the box I took a
quick look to make sure it had a USB connection on it then thru the
cables that came with it in a box with two or three million other
cables since I already keep the standard USB cables in my bag.
Turns out, the end of the USB that plugs into the camera is a
proprietary Fuji plug. Still USB, just not the same shape. This is
one of those things that's really annoying. It doesn't appear to be
a size issue since the cable is almost identical to a standard USB.
It's just a little bit different. Just enough so that Fuji can sell
you their replacement instead of being able to get a standard one
off the shelf if you don't happen to already have five other ones
laying around. So, I finally dug thru the box and got the cable.
I've had the camera for a few months now and have 414 shots on it.
The good news out of all this is that I could have continued to
shoot for at least a little while at the same rate without running
out of space. Most photographers I know have a story about a friend
or relative who finished up a roll of film in the good old days and
when they got the prints back saw that not only did they have this
years 4th of July photos on it, but last years as well. (Nuge just
[posted a similar thought](http://noroomthanks.blogspot.com/2007/10/like-never-developing-film.html).)
What is increasingly both good and bad for me is that with the
amount of storage you can get these days, it's less critical to
pull stuff off immediately. This is good because I don't feel
rushed, but can be bad since without a deadline I'm likely to leave
stuff on a card for a long time.
