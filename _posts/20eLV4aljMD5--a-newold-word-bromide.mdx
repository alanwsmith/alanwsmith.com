Toward the end of Rand's "The Fountainhead", the word "bromide" is
used a lot. I've only ever heard it used in its chemical reference
before. Never would have guessed it had a second meaning. broÂ·mide
n. 1. a. A binary compound of bromine with another element, such as
silver. b. Potassium bromide. 2. a. A commonplace remark or notion;
a platitude. See Synonyms at clichÃ©. b. A tiresome person; a bore.
In the book it's used as both 2a and 2b. Mainly the former. Each
time I come across it in the text, I become aware of the fact that
I'm reading and I realize I wasn't seeing words until I hit it.
It's not unlike a speed bump that you didn't notice and it jars you
out of auto-pilot.
