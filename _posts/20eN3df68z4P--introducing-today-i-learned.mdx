Code snippets represent a large portion of my posts. They generally include, "While working on _X_, I ran into issue _Y_ and came up with this solution _Z_..." type descriptions for context. Interesting as that might be, they aren't critical. What they are is time consuming to produce. I post less often because of that. Inspired by the HashRocket's _Today I Learned_ blog<sup>1</sup>, I'm changing my approach and dropping the backstory. 

Starting today, code snippet posts will fall under umbrella "_Today I Learned: ..._" titles. There will still be enough context to make sense, but the specific reasons I went down any particular rabbit hole will be greatly reduced. I figure this will cut two thirds or more off writing time.

Less muss, less fuss, more posts.
