We've been having a monsoon here in North Florida over the past few
days. This morning, I had to go to a meeting in another building.
It was less than 200 yards away so we walked. I had an umbrella,
but the rain was coming down so hard that it was bouncing up so
much that by the time I got to the meeting, my pants were
completely soaked up to about my knees. So, I got to sit in a six
hour meeting with wet socks. Not so much fun.
