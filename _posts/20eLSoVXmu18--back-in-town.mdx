Took a little time off from work, posting, thinking and everything
else I could over the past little while. Took a trip back to HSV
for Thanksgiving. Actually got to take a few days this time since i
need to use up a little vacation before the end of the year to keep
from loosing it. Mom, of course, put me to work a little, but
nothing too bad. We had 16 or so various extended family down for
the big dinner. In addition we had two soldiers from Redstone with
us. Mom had seen an "adopt-a-soldier" thing and the newspaper and
being her, signed up. It was a little weird but nice to host a
couple Army guys who couldn't be home with their family. Anyway,
I'm really glad to be back at my place. My hermit like tendency
kicks in after a few days of being out of my own place.
