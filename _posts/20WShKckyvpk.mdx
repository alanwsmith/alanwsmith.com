[Jay Maisel](http://www.jaymaisel.com/biography/) is a master photographer. You've seen his work before on the cover of Miles Davis' "Kind of Blue" album. This week, I was lucky enough to attend a session taught by Mr. Maisel at Photoshop World. He discussed his street photography and capturing people in their native environments. It seemed only appropriate to take this shot of him in the same vein.
