title: Weapon of Choice Dune
---

Just figured this one out. In Fatboy Slims'
"[Weapon of Choice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WW8flwpH-Q)"
(you know, the one with Christoper Walken), on of the lines is
something like: "Walk with rhythm and it won't attract the worm."
Totally from Dune. Who knew?
