these
[Wobble Wedges](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/003491.php) on
[Cool Tools](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/). These things could make
great promotional tchotchkes that would actually serve a practical
purpose. Print a logo, web site and a slogan like "Stability
brought to you by ACME Computer Systems" on them and pass them out.
I'd be happy to keep a handful in my bag and leave them stuck under
tables where ever they are needed. In coffee shops and restaurants
tables get jostled around enough that you can be confident they
would get bumped out of place from time to time and have to be put
back in place. The brand message would get seen on a regular basis
and associated with a "well isn't that thoughtful" idea.
