I accidentally grabbed a pack of Gatorade G2 instead of the regular stuff on a recent trip to the store. This is the first time I've been pleasantly surprised after unintentionally grabbing a low calorie version of something. I can't drink too much of the regular stuff. It has too sugary a taste. The G2 is much better.
