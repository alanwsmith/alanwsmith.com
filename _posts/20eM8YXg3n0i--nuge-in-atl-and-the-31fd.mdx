title: Nuge in ATL and the 31fd
---

I've mentioned that I've been traveling to Atlanta a lot over the
past few days. On one of the trips, I managed to catch up with Nuge
and the wife out at a coffee house where he was playing a few
tunes. Here's a snap of him groove'n.

It was a little wild because [Amy](http://amylashley.net/) was
playing as well. Literally haven't seen her since High School. Both
she and Nuge sounded great. And to complete the wild round up,
there was also Stacy who apparently graduated the year before me,
but I don't think I ever knew. Here's the two of them. Stacy on the
left and Amy on the right.

Now for some a photo geek tangent: I should mention that these are
more shots from my most recently acquired point and shoot which is
a [FujiFilm 31fd](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/fujifilmf31fd/).
The primary reason I got this camera was because of the reviews of
it's low light performance. I'm really not a fan of on camera
flash, but with most point and shoots you pretty much have to use
it to get anything. I had a Canon point and shoot before this that
offered a "high ISO" setting, but the images taken with that were
so grainy they weren't really worth it. I've been really impressed
with the little Fuji. This image of Nuge was hand held at ISO 800,
f/2.8 @ 1/4 sec. The camera doesn't have vibration reduciton which
would have been nice, but since there is no mirror movement, you at
least have a chance with longer shutter speeds.
