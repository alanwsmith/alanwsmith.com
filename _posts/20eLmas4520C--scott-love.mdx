I found out earlier this week that Scott Love was killed in Iraq.
He's the first person I have known to be killed in war. That's just
fucked up. When I was growing up, war was just a game I played with
G.I. Joes. Until a few years ago it always seemed like something
that belong, in real life, only to other countries or our past.
Here's a cache of the
