This is a test of different video and font settings to figure what the best thing to use on stream is. All tests were run on a thru an Elgato 4K60 Pro (the monitor shouldn't matter, but it's a Dell 24" 4K P2415Q with native resolution of 3840x2160)

Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them
