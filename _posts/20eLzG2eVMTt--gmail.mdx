I've recently starting a migration over to gmail. I've played
around with it on and off for a while but didn't make a move for
two main reasons. 1) I'm a bit paranoid my email being used to send
ads to me and 2) I didn't like the idea of using an unencrypted web
page (once again because of my healthy paranoia). The ad thing is
just on principal and is actually fairly easy to overcome with some
hacks out there. The main thing was sending everything over the
clear on whatever connection I happend to be on. If I only sent
emails from home this wouldn't be a big deal, but I'm often on open
wifi and various corporate networks. The good news is that it's
easy to secure all your gmail traffic. Instead of using
"http://mail.google.com/" you can simply use
"https:mail.google.com/". As near as I can tell, your login is
always sent secure, but if you start with the "http**s**" all your
correspondence is encrypted up to the google servers.
