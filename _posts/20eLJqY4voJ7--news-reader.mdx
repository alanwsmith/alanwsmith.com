Recently I've been using "SharpReader" as an RSS news aggregator.  
http://www.sharpreader.net/  
It's one that you install on your machine which I was trying to
avoid, but it's the first one that I've found that lets you view
all stories by date instead of having them all grouped into their
own feed. So far, vary pleased with it.
