I've had some weird illness over the past couple days. Not sure
what it is. Doesn't feel quite like a cold or the flu, but I
suppose it could be. Two nights ago, I couldn't get warm no matter
what. I had blankets piled on and was still freezing all night. For
the most part, I would only get sleep in short bursts before waking
back up. It was pretty miserable. One of the weird fever dreams I
had was that I was talking with someone and for some reason they
reached out and slapped me in the head. It was so real that it woke
me up. I swear I felt it and heard it.
