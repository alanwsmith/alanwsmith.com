title: Three Years to Stability
type: post

Three years ago, I had a full blown manic episode. It landed me in the psych ward where I learned I've been living with undiagnosed bipolar 1 disorder my entire life.

The peak of mania was brief. Just a couple weeks. The depression that followed lasted years. It got so intense I started to make an attempt on my life. I wound up back in the psych ward on suicide watch. 

After leaving the ward, I started an Intensive Outpatient Program to help deal with the depression. It lasted seven weeks. I thought it would cure me. That I wouldn't have suicidal thoughts any more. That wasn't the case. They were ever-present until earlier this year. 

It's taken 36 med changes, a wonderful and amazing therapist, and the full run of the past three years, but, for the first time in my life, I'm stable. 

It's been a hell of a slog. I almost lost, but didn't. So, I'm absolutely taking it as a win.
