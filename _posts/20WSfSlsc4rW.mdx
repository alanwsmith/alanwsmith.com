T turned me onto the [pocketmod](http://www.pocketmod.com/) a while
ago. It's bascially like a
[Hipster PDA](http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda/),
but a little more functional. I used to try to carry a little
notebook with me, but since it was a separate thing I would often
leave it at home. I can fit a pocketmod into my money clip (yes, I
use a money clip instead of a wallet. Less bulk = better) and it's
pretty much always with me. The other thing I add to the system is
a [Pilot G2 mini pen](http://www.pilotpen.us/detail.asp?PenID=77).
These are nice because they are about 1/2 the height of a regular
pen so they don't bug you when you carry them in your pocket.
