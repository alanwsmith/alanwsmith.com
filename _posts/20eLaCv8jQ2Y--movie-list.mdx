just posted a copy of the AFI top 100 list so I can
[check off the movies I've seen](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/top-100-movie-checklist/).
Right now, I'm about half way thru. There are some movies (like
Rear Window) that I'm pretty sure I've seen, but it's tied up with
some other films in my brain so I'm not counting it yet.
