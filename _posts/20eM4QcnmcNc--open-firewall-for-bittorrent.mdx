This is mainly a note for me. If you run a bittorrent program like
the open source [Azureus](http://azureus.sourceforge.net/) and have
a firewall like [Comodo](http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/)
(which I highly recommend), you will need to open the port in the
firewall to get the best use out of the bittorrent client. First
figure out which port you need to open up by looking under the
Tools menu in the "Connection" setting. It'll have the
incoming/outgoing port number there. Then you need to go into the
"Network Monitor" tab on the side of Comodo and create a new
firewall rule with the following: Action = Allow Protocol = TCP or
UDP Direction = In Source IP = Any Remote IP = your IP adress (or
"Any" ) Source port = Any Remote port = the port your bittorent
program uses for the TCP/UDP connections To give credit where
credit is due, I got this from
[this post](http://forums.comodo.com/help/azureus_yellow_and_blue_faces-t2562.0.html).
I just want to make sure if it disappears I don't have to hunt down
how to set it again.
