Auto-Generated Transcript (I'm in the process of getting this formatted)

00:00
[Music]
00:05
all right
00:06
hello world
00:08
welcome to this edition of uh we're
00:11
gonna start things new and they're doing
00:13
things again but dude away or something
00:15
like that i don't know uh that didn't
00:17
really like introduction at all but
00:18
that's fine we're just gonna roll with
00:19
it so this is this is definitely a new
00:21
thing for me not the recording aspect of
00:23
it but the fact that i'm recording
00:26
uh on my stream setup in my house
00:28
normally when i record these things i'm
00:29
doing it in my car
00:31
i've been doing that for a couple years
00:32
and it's nice so
00:34
um we'll have to see how this goes i
00:37
i don't know we'll see what see how it
00:38
goes this this is going to be the first
00:40
experimentation we'll see what's up i'm
00:41
going to move the mic around we'll
00:42
figure out like where i'm going to get
00:43
if i'm going to look at the camera or
00:45
not um for the people listening on
00:47
straight the podcast without the video
00:48
you won't notice any of that stuff um
00:51
i think i'm going to target this more
00:52
for a podcast format than necessarily a
00:55
video or a vlog format so if you're
00:57
watching the video cool but like i'm not
00:59
going to try and like do presenting
01:00
stuff for video
01:02
that's just going to be the way you
01:03
consume it so cool all right i you know
01:06
i'm not a fan of
01:08
too much of the introductiony stuff like
01:12
you listen to some shows and
01:15
there's this kind of thing where it's
01:16
like oh and this thing we're gonna talk
01:17
about this and this and this and this
01:19
and like
01:20
i understand exactly why you need to do
01:22
that or why it's helpful to have that
01:24
but at the same time it's like okay
01:26
don't let's just get to the thing and
01:27
see what happens but then if you just
01:29
try and throw people in
01:30
they're less likely if they don't have
01:33
like a grounding to get there then you
01:35
know it's can be tricky uh i see the
01:37
same thing happens with me with uh
01:39
movies with trailers
01:41
where
01:43
i used to really not like looking at
01:44
trailer or watching trailers
01:47
because they would so often show you
01:50
some portion of the movie that was
01:51
basically a critical aspect of it that
01:53
it's like
01:54
when you walk up to that portion of the
01:56
movie
01:58
you see the same scene that's coming up
02:00
inhaler and so you're like flying into
02:03
it and you're like oh this is clearly
02:05
that same thing that i saw in the
02:06
trailer and even though they cut
02:08
cut it two seconds before the pivotal
02:10
thing i know we're about to see the
02:12
pivotal thing because like the music was
02:13
there and like all that
02:15
so i i kind of am not a fan of that but
02:18
at the same time
02:19
that's changed a little bit for me and
02:20
now i do kind of like
02:22
at least getting a touch of the tone of
02:26
the movie
02:27
so
02:29
like what the what it's gonna look like
02:30
a little bit like kind of who the
02:32
characters are or who the actors are i
02:34
guess
02:34
um just just a touch of it so like if
02:37
it's a marvel movie i don't need to see
02:40
too much about it like it's just gonna
02:41
be a marvel movie and you can get some
02:42
hype stuff from the trailer and that's
02:44
cool but like
02:46
with dune when it came out
02:48
i was like
02:50
going back and forth on this thing about
02:51
ooh do i like trailers now i don't know
02:53
i mean i've always liked them but do i
02:54
want to watch them but i watched the
02:55
doom when i'm really glad i did because
02:58
it shows it had to like
03:00
and i want to say the tone of the movie
03:02
but i mean that both visually and
03:04
i mean that both
03:06
melodically like harmonically and
03:07
musically um as well as
03:11
like the the tone of the speech and the
03:12
tone of the colors right the color tones
03:15
um and i'm really kind of glad that i
03:16
had that set in a little bit because
03:18
it's like
03:20
i don't know it's it's like a it's like
03:21
a little appetizer i guess if done right
03:24
that it's just like okay here we're
03:25
gonna we're gonna go ahead and get you
03:27
get you kind of like geared up and ready
03:29
for the rest of this meal and this
03:30
thing's going to compliment it and we're
03:32
going to come through and like have it
03:34
be this nice introduction but also we're
03:37
not going to spoil the meal and i mean i
03:39
guess maybe that's where the trailer
03:40
kind of stuff can can hit you is like
03:43
so you can have an appetizer but if they
03:45
give you too much of the appetizer like
03:46
it spoils your dinner
03:48
or you're just like dinner isn't as good
03:49
and it's kind of uncomfortable and like
03:51
yeah you know like you're just ready to
03:52
be done with it but like if you get just
03:53
the right amount of appetizer like it
03:56
gets you gets you like oh i'm ready to
03:57
eat like this is delicious and they're
03:58
just like
04:00
leads into the meal in a very pleasant
04:02
fashion um
04:04
so we'll see actually i don't know if
04:06
this is gonna work for that or not
04:08
because it's it's it's funny for me
04:09
because these are
04:10
like i like i said i've probably done a
04:12
hundred of these um maybe even 200 who
04:14
knows where
04:15
i've just been recording and running it
04:17
and just as as a as a meta thing here
04:19
like i'm kind of okay with this the the
04:22
thing that i was wondering about was
04:23
where
04:24
um
04:28
when i do them in the car i'm driving so
04:30
like i've got something that i am doing
04:32
while i'm talking and that occupies kind
04:34
of the physical space
04:36
uh the physicalness while i'm talking
04:38
and i kind of keep going and right now
04:40
i'm emoting very like i'm moving around
04:42
a fair amount which i think kind of
04:43
takes care of that as well
04:45
i'm a fairly kinetic speaker uh when i
04:47
get going so
04:49
i just wasn't sure if
04:52
like how that would translate if i kind
04:54
of get stuck by
04:57
having to basically do the video and do
04:58
it sitting still and then also with the
05:00
camera there um
05:02
because i keep the camera on me when i'm
05:03
doing the the car videos
05:05
just because that's how i first started
05:07
doing them was recording was just doing
05:09
on um and i've continued to do that
05:11
because it's kind of a vlog or whatever
05:12
but i don't think these will be
05:14
i don't know maybe i'll figure out
05:15
something interesting to do with these
05:16
right so i'm throwing this up and i'm
05:18
gonna do it on a green screen or i'm
05:20
doing it on a green screen i'm doing
05:21
this with my with my stream setup um and
05:25
one of the things i was thinking about
05:26
was like we could set up to do
05:29
different versions of the videos so if
05:31
people are in the videos
05:33
then or people are into the videos or
05:34
watching it on video uh you could just
05:37
have like one version that's just like
05:38
straight me the green screen you could
05:40
have one version where like hey we drop
05:41
out the the green screen and we put in
05:44
elephants in the background i don't know
05:46
or like um
05:48
there's a
05:49
uh another streamer uh alex trost
05:53
who has done some stuff where he has
05:55
people come on and interviews them and
05:57
one of the things or one of the people
05:58
he had on and i forget this person's
06:00
name uh willing and show notes if i
06:03
remember to do that um was was doing
06:05
generative art
06:07
and like there were these really cool
06:08
patterns of
06:10
uh
06:11
uh and like all these complicated words
06:13
and math and all these other things like
06:15
i don't really understand
06:17
details of it but like they showed you
06:20
the math and they showed you the
06:22
formulas to plug in and they show you
06:23
the dials to kind of mess around with
06:25
and then you can go and like make your
06:26
own stuff so maybe we'll have some like
06:27
generative art in some of these um and
06:29
kind of come around and like bang around
06:31
um
06:32
but again i think the i think the key
06:34
here though is
06:36
and this has taken a little bit of a
06:37
switch in my brain to actually identify
06:39
this as i am thinking of this now more
06:41
as specifically a podcast so it is a
06:44
thing by the way this is meta talk right
06:46
so everybody's favorite thing is you
06:47
talk about the thing you're talking
06:48
about but like when you get started like
06:49
that's kind of a natural thing to do and
06:51
like it's
06:53
if if you are interested in
06:57
this at all you will hear a bunch of
06:59
that type of stuff um maybe jump forward
07:02
a few episodes
07:04
when we get the kind of the early things
07:05
out of the way because this the like i
07:07
as i work on projects and this is a
07:09
project um
07:11
i often go through and examine the
07:12
projects and one of the things all right
07:13
then like i'm i'm
07:15
not constantly but i i i oscillate back
07:18
and forth between
07:19
um
07:20
heads down working on the thing and then
07:23
kind of stepping back and taking a look
07:24
and seeing at the things that i've
07:25
worked on and then like
07:27
you know kind of
07:28
going in this liminal space of the back
07:30
and forthness
07:33
and this because this is part of a
07:35
project like that is going to be part of
07:36
it and because i'm making a transition
07:38
from the way that i'm doing the
07:38
recordings
07:40
this is going to be an aspect of that
07:42
that we're going to examine so cool if
07:44
you like it sweet if you don't okay
07:47
um i also i like i'm i'm trying not to
07:49
do that as much if you like it cool if
07:50
you don't like it also cool like
07:52
that like that should be implicit these
07:55
days
07:57
but it also still feels like a a thing
07:59
that is
08:02
like i don't know it's almost cliche but
08:04
like cliches exist for a reason
08:06
and
08:07
like i'm not diminishing it it's just
08:09
like one of those like i kind of wish i
08:10
hadn't said that because it's like you
08:12
get you like you already
08:14
it's like i'm giving you the power to
08:16
make that decision but like you already
08:17
have the power to make that decision
08:18
like you're already going to make that
08:20
decision
08:21
but it's
08:22
it's not meant in that way i don't think
08:24
most of the time when people say it it's
08:25
a bit more as a friendly like hey like
08:27
no like no harm no foul you're not gonna
08:29
you're not gonna insult me if you don't
08:30
like the thing that i'm making
08:33
i'm gonna be a little bummed potentially
08:35
if you don't like the thing that i'm
08:36
making but that's not but i don't want
08:37
to put that
08:39
like
08:40
uh
08:41
i don't want to hold you emotionally
08:43
hostage to the fact that if you don't
08:44
like it you're gonna hurt my feelings
08:46
there's that there's a really
08:49
interesting like um
08:52
reverberation that can happen between uh
08:54
artist and audience with that kind of
08:57
stuff where
08:59
some number of people
09:00
like i i believe very much that most
09:03
people don't want to
09:04
make other people uncomfortable or
09:06
suffer um
09:08
and so
09:10
you'll have a thing like oh i've made
09:11
this thing and like it's it's a kind of
09:13
a natural reaction or it's my natural
09:14
reaction i think a lot of us
09:16
to go through and say hey cool great
09:18
even if we're not super psyched about it
09:21
now one of the things i try to do is
09:23
look at
09:25
parts so like
09:29
i'm a pretty big believer that if
09:30
somebody has made a thing
09:33
even if the overall thing itself isn't
09:35
that great there
09:36
is
09:37
almost always
09:39
something neat or interesting or
09:42
cool to find in there even if it's not
09:44
new and even if it's not groundbreaking
09:46
because by the way most stuff isn't like
09:49
almost nothing is new or groundbreaking
09:51
like everything comes is coming from
09:53
something that came before it and the
09:55
novelty with which we put those things
09:56
together
09:57
is generally speaking not tremendous but
10:01
that does not mean that it's not cool
10:03
and not interesting and not neat so
10:06
finding those kind of like little places
10:09
and those little things
10:10
can be a little bit like oh cool i like
10:12
what you did here and then even if you
10:13
fall back to the other one they're not
10:14
fall back but even if you
10:18
move the perspective into hey i like the
10:20
work that you did so even if it's not
10:22
really the thing that you did is is
10:25
what's impressing me as much i like that
10:26
you did work to do a thing
10:28
and like i think that's a really
10:29
important thing for us to kind of talk
10:33
about and to kind of push on a little
10:34
bit and wow i just all of a sudden i'm
10:35
getting like i feel like i'm getting
10:36
like uh this is the thing oh god this
10:39
like okay this just took a turn weird
10:40
for me um
10:43
cause like who the hell am i but at the
10:45
same time like i don't know i have
10:46
thoughts so here's some thoughts
10:48
but like
10:49
i i'm gonna try not to get like yeah and
10:51
see now now we're doing the meta thing
10:52
again so this is the back and forth this
10:54
is the back and forth and there will be
10:55
some of that there will be a lot of that
10:56
for me because i kind of keep poking on
10:58
the thing but
11:01
i don't know that like i don't want to
11:02
try and get this into like
11:04
actually you know what i don't know what
11:06
i want this to be yet so
11:08
this is gonna become the thing that it's
11:09
gonna become and
11:12
like i've got some ideas in the back of
11:15
my head very loosely just based off the
11:17
prior stuff that i've been doing but
11:19
basically it comes down to i'm going to
11:21
turn on the mic i'm going to talk into
11:22
the mic and whatever happens happens and
11:24
like it's kind of getting all over the
11:27
place so uh i think that'll wrap it for
11:29
this one because short and sweet i have
11:31
no idea how long this is because i'm not
11:33
watching any timers at all uh also i'm
11:35
just now aware that there's a camera
11:36
gear again so clearly this is gonna be
11:38
one of those things where this is not
11:39
about the camera it's about the voice so
11:42
i hope you all have enjoyed it uh we
11:44
will see you next time the other thing
11:46
that i'm going to do right now though is
11:48
we're going to make a second episode
11:50
immediately that i call an after show
11:51
this is something i've been doing on the
11:52
other ones where
11:53
this was the main topic so i just kind
11:55
of say man we're done and then i'm not
11:57
going to clip this episode and then i'm
11:59
immediately going to keep recording like
12:00
i'm not going to turn the mic off and
12:01
that will be the after show
12:03
because i find that it's a neat to kind
12:04
of like switch up the gears a little bit
12:06
and kind of just like okay we did a
12:08
thing and then cut review do whatever
12:11
that will do it for this episode
12:13
uh jump into the after show next if you
12:15
want to or punt way forward if you want
12:17
to or have a good day
12:19
be kind be cool we'll see you around
12:21
cheers
