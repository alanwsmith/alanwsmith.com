title: Safely Develop AWS Lambdas In Localstack That Talk To S3
---

If you're developing a lambda function in [Localstack](https://localstack.cloud/) that needs to talk to S3 (or another AWS service) you need to set a `endpoint_url` parameter during development. For example:

```python3
s3r = boto3.resource('s3', endpoint_url='http://localhost:4572')
```

But, that's only for development. Once you move to prod, the `endpoint_url` argument needs to be removed. 

I deal with that like this:

```python3
import boto3
import json 
import os
import sys

    
def lambda_handler(event, context):

    if 'ENV' not in os.environ:
        print("ERROR: Required `ENV` environmental variable not defined. Process halted.")
        sys.exit()

    elif os.environ['ENV'] == 'dev':
        print("INFO: Starting in localstack dev environment")
        s3r = boto3.resource('s3', endpoint_url='http://localhost:4572')
        
    elif os.environ['ENV'] == 'prod':
        print("INFO: Starting in prod environment")
        s3r = boto3.resource('s3')
        
    else:
        print(f"ERROR: Received invalid `ENV` environmental variable: {os.environ['env']}. Process halted.")
        sys.exit()
        
    # Implement your code here
```

That code does the following:

1. Make sure the `ENV` environmental variable is set. If it's not, the process is halted. 
2. Once the `ENV` is confirmed to be there it checks to confirm it's either `dev` or `prod`
3. If it's `dev` or `prod` it sets `s3r` with or without the `endpoint_url` parameters as needed
4. If the `ENV` variable isn't `dev` or `prod` it halts the process. 

Basically, it makes things explicit to help prevent accidentally running against production (which would happen if you don't set the `endpoint_url` and use valid bucket/key names). 

When developing locally, I run this in the terminal environment I'm going to test with:

```
export ENV=dev
```

And to setup the production Lambda function in AWS, go under the "Configuration" tab after making the function, choosing "Environment variables" and setting a Key of "ENV" to the Value "prod".

Obviously, this is Python, but the same technique will work with anything that supports environmental variables.

Happy coding.
