title: Driving Range Bugs vs Off
---

I went to a public driving range today after work to hit a bag of
balls and try to practice some of the things from my recent leson.
As soon as I got on the range I discovered that it's a favorite
hang out of no-see-ums. For those of you unfamilar they are tiny
little bugs that have a very annoying bite that's surprisingly big
considering their size. I had some "Off! Botanicals" in my bag that
I've used a couple time before and put it on. It worked amazingly
well. Every now and then a no-see-um would run into me and come to
a forced landing on my arm, but they never bit after I put the Off!
on. It's a lotion which is a little odd to me, but it works like a
champ.
