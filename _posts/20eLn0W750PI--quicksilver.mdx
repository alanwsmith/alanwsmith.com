I'm reading (or trying to read) the Neal Stephenson book
"Quicksilver" right now. I've read two of his other books before
("Snow Crash" and "Cryptonomicron") and enjoyed them both, but I'm
about to give up on Quicksilver. It's set in the past and he seems
intent of focusing more on historical details than telling a story.
It's rare that I don't finish a book that I start, but I think it's
about to happen. Oh well.
