A few weeks ago I was driving when I noticed what I think can best be described as Dot Matrix Sky Writing. There were 5 jets crusing along puffing smoke in a cooridinate effort to spell out "Geico" across the sky over and over again. The results was pretty neat: ![image](/blog/wp-content/uploads/img_0232.jpg) I'm not sure if you can make out the jets in this image or not, but they are at the right side finishing up the "O". There was a sixth jet that was trailing behind that who wasn't adding anything to the smoke. I guess he was helping to keep everything in line.
