There is a conference called TED that takes place every year. Some
amazing tech stuff is shown there. One that I saw last year was of
a guy named Jeff Han who setup a "multi-touch interface"
([video here](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/65)). This
year, one of the ones that has blown me away is a hugely variable
image navigation and matching tool.
([video here](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/129)).
This one is a little wild to think about some of the later stuff he
gets into with the demo in terms of image matching and association.
For example, at some point, processors are going to be fast enough
to do this with video feeds. 1984's got nothing on this. Orwell
would shit himself. F-ing amazing though.
