This is the first real post in the new blogging software. I've moved everything over from the former blogger.com account. I like the idea of having my stuff be mine and not under someone else's control. 

So, I've installed WordPress and am running with it. I've still got a lot to figure out about it (like how comments work for other people). 

Anyways, welcome to the new place.
