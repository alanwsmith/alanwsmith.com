I was looking for a NASDAQ index fund and came across
[this article](http://www.smartmoney.com/etffocus/index.cfm?story=20060315)
about [QQQDirect](http://qqqdirect.com/). It is a commission free
way to do dollar-cost investing in a NASDAQ tracking "spider"
stock. If you aren't already investing in your 401K at work, or
ROTH IRA, start that first. But, if you are looking for a long term
investing option outside of a retirement account, this is a good
one. The fact that there is no commision is great, as all the money
you put in will work for you. And the fee for maintaing the stock
is incredibly low. If you put $50/month in this at the average
return is 8% (a conservative estimate), you'll have a little over
$73,000 in thirty years.
