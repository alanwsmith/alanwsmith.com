after lots of searching. Making my own link to make sure I can find
it again. To use mysqldump on a Mac running OS X 10.5 (Leopard),
run the following from the command line:
`sudo ln -s /usr/local/mysql-5.0.67-osx10.5-x86/bin/mysqldump /usr/bin/mysqldump`
(I think I had to manually install MySQL from the supplemental CDs
that came with the Mac. I'm assuming this version of mysqldump was
installed at the same time.)
