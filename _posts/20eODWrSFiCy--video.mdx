I'm using `gatsby-remark-responsive-iframe` to do the vidoes and just embedding the youtube iframes directly. 

This is an example. Should be able to just change the ID


```html
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t10aFJRpggU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

YouTube provides a privacy enhanced version, but it's not working for me. Might be my ad blockers, which would be ironic

```html
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/t10aFJRpggU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

OLD NOTES

Put video in with:


- gatsby-remark-embed-video

- gatsby-remark-responsive-iframe


---  

https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-embed-video/?=video


---

These work:

```
video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Xc9gXyf2G4
youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Xc9gXyf2G4
vimeo: https://vimeo.com/5299404
```



These don't, even though the docs say they should:

TODO: Verify this without the tic marks which I think you might have done

`vimeo: 5299404`
`youtube: 2Xc9gXyf2G4`
