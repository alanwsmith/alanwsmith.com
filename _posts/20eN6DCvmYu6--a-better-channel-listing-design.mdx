title: A Better Channel Listing Design

TODO: This is one to work on and polish up. Right now, it's just a collection of ideas/snippets.

Examples abound. Sometimes the result of institutional inertia. Sometimes because no one took a step back to look at what they were working on. TV channel listings are a great example. 

In the pre-historic days of fewer than ten available channels, sorting by number worked just fine. They'd fit in a single view and it was easy enough to remember the entire set. Before switching channels showed the network along with the number, it was even helpful. But those days are long gone. With hundreds of channels (in multiple definitions) the old layout has outlived its usefulness. Finding a channel on a system you're not familiar with is tedious and time consuming. 






These designs were also helpful




Now that we have hundreds of channels across both standard and high definition, that design needs to go.
