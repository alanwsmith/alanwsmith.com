title: Good little open source clip art site

While looking for an open source clip art light-bulb the first site
google returned was [openclipart.org](http://www.openclipart.org/).
However, it looks like they are in the middle of moving stuff
around so most of the images aren't showing up for me. After a
little more digging, I found [clker.com](http://www.clker.com/)
which is showing me the images. I'm just dropping a note here so I
can find it easily later.
