title: That Time I Almost Lost My House
---

So. I almost lost my house. 

Sometime during the years of bipolar depression I missed paying the property taxes on my house. The county scheduled to sell it at auction two days from now. I've known about it for a few weeks, but it took me until today to get myself to take care of it. I can't fully explain why I didn't do it sooner. Part of it is that I just don't have the super-charged starting energy of hypo-mania. I think some of if is the hangover from isolation (which was smothering me way more than I realized). 

Whatever the case, it's fixed now and with that relief I have more energy to deal with everything else.

(Incidentally, episode 5 of the podcast is largely about this. If that's not out at the time you're reading it, it will be within a couple of days.)
