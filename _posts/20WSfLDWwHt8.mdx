The guy who sits across the hall from me has been out sick this
week. Tuesday someone told me it was the stomach flu. Today, I hear
that they aren't sure what it is and they have him in an isolation
chamber running tests and no one goes in there without a moon suit
on. Yikes. I hope he gets better quickly and no one else (like,
say, the person that sits closest in proximity to him during the
day) gets whatever the hell it is.
