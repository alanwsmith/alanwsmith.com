I'm pretty impressed with the camera on the iPhone 3GS. Here's a
snap. All I did to this was crop a little to straighten the image,
resize down to 550 pixels wide and then apply "Smart sharpen" in
Photoshop.

Pretty damn good quality considering it's a tiny camera on a cell
phone. (Also, the wind was blowing a little so the blooms were
moving a decent amount. It was bright enough that the action was
stopped pretty well.) Note: I know that the image is breaking the
current design. Eventually, when I get time to drop in a real
template it'll fit.....
