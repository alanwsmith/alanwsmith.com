[Trigger Trap][1] is out. 

It's a cable that lets you connect your iPhone to your camera. I can't believe it took someone this long to launch one. I've wanted to build one of these since the first day I got my iPhone. Unfortunately, I don't have the electrical engineering skills (or the time) to undertake such a project.
