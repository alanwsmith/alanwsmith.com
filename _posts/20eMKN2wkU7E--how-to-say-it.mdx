The tag line for the web site [Forvo.com](http://forvo.com/) is
"All the words in the world. Pronounced." Using the power of people
who want to contribute, they are creating a catalog of audio
recordings of how words are spoken. You can contribute too, if you
like. Behold yet another awesome tool provided by the intertubes.
The site could use some better
[bablefish](http://babelfish.altavista.com/) type
cross-referencing. Even without that, a creative person could
probably assemble a pretty good foreign language course using this
as a back bone. Sentence construction would be tough, but for the
simple individual word standpoint, there's some nice potential. Now
that I think about it, the potential of the internet to provide
foreign language education is HUGE. A quick search makes it look
like at least one site is working on this:
[phrasebase.com](http://www.phrasebase.com/english/). Using a
Wikipedia approach to foreign language teaching/learning should be
well within the realm of possibility.
