title: Hi Ted plus Battlestar
---

Hello back to you Ted. Good to hear from you. Or, read from you, or
whatever. Chalk another one up for the internet on the reconnecting
people board. Boggles the mind, really.  
To answer your question, I have been watching the new Battlestar.
To put it simply, I don't think I've ever seen a show that's been
so well put together. I haven't seen last nights episode yet, but
I'll get a chance probably today or tomorrow.  
That show really puts in perspective how bad most of the stuff is.
Here's to hoping that it's wildly successful and the studios
realize that it's largely due to the quality. Of course, they will
make 100 different rehashes of it. But maybe, just maybe it'll help
push the quality controls to a higher standard.
