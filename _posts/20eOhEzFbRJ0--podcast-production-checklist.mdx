TODO: Build a script that does the upload stuff.


- Do stream setup:
- Click to Record instead of stream
- Stop and restart before doing aftershows
- Move clips to podcast directory
- Trim video and add fade-in and fade-out in premier
- Normalize audio to `-3dB` in Premiere (Right click - Audio Gain - Normalize Max Peak to -3dB)
- Make Black and White:

Effects -> Video Effects -> Color Correction -> Lumetri Color

and dropping the effect on the clip

Then I mess around with the parameters with the following adjustment starting points:

- Saturation: 0
- Exposure: 0.7
- Highlights: 22.8
- Blacks: -19.3

Then 

- Add Vignette 
    - Amount: -3.0
    - Midpoint: 50
    - Roundness: 100
    - Feather: 100

- Export Media - Format: H.264 - Preset Match Source
- Upload to YouTube with `ThePodOfAlan - Episode #` title
- Add to YouTube `ThePodOfAlan` playlist
- Upload to Vimeo
- Put up on the site. 
- Figure out how to get transcripts
