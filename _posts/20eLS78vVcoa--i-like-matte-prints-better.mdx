I got my first order in from printroom.com today. It was a shot I
took out at Simon's Wine bar. (I haven't posted it yet, but I'll
probably do that this weekend.) I'm very impressed with the quality
of printroom. I actually had a "pro" account setup with them for a
little while as a test, but shut it down before I had gotten any
prints from them. One of the things that I've been looking for is a
service that doesn't put their branding all over the back of the
prints and Dave let me know that printroom doesn't do this. So, I
ordered this print. I've very pleased with the quality. The blacks
are nice and deep, the shadows aren't all blocked up and the tonal
range is great. The only problem with the print is that I
accidentally order a glossy instead of matte print. Even though you
can get a little bit better "pop" with a glossy print and the
blacks tend to be deeper with glossy, I really prefer matte. Well
really, what I like is a "Luster" surface. I think with Kodak
papers it's there "E" surface. With Ilford I'm pretty sure it was
their "Pearl" surface. Maybe it's that it feels more like a canvas.
Or, maybe it's that you don't get a glare/reflection like a glossy
print, but something about it just makes it easier for me to get
into a print. So, I'll do another print with those guys and see how
their matte offering strikes me.
