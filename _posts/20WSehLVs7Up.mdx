There is nothing quite like going into someone's office for a
meeting with three other people and then 5 min in, they pick up a
call and proceed to talk for 30 min. At least this time it's about
business, but it's nothing that couldn't wait for us to finish up
the meeting.  
Note: don't have meetings in someone's office. Go to a conference
room.
