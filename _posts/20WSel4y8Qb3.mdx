I've heard of Sudoku before, but never saw a free online version to
play till today. Granted, I hadn't really looked. When I stumbled
on this site I figured I'd give it a try. I didn't really know what
to expect, but this shit is hard. It took me several hours to get
thru one of the "Easy" ones.  
Of course, part of the problem might have been that I was only
using two of the three rules to play the game. (I missed the part
about getting one number in each 3x3 square.) Oh well, live and
learn.
