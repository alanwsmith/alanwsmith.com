Some time ago I discovered
[optoutprescreen.com](https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t) which
lets you tell the three major credit bureaus that you don't want to
get all those pre-approved credit card solicitations in the mail.
After I got my house, I was getting probably 20-30 a week. None of
which I wanted. I have one card and that's all I want. Within a few
months, my junk mail was way, way, way down. I've been meaning to
try to kill some of the rest of it and have known about the Direct
Marketing Association, but have done a little more research that
points to the Abacus Catalog Alliance as well. It took me a little
while to cross reference, but "Smart Money" has
[this article](http://www.smartmoney.com/dealoftheday/index.cfm?story=20070206)
up with how to opt out. I also verified the Abacus Opt Out address
by searching the epsilon.com web site and getting to
[this page](http://www.abacusoptout.com/). Epsilon is the company
that maintains the Abacus database. By the way, if you want to
freak out your privacy meter, jump around the epsilon web site for
a bit. Once again, in some ways 1984 ain't got shit on 2008. In my
searching, I saw another address for the Epsilon/Abacus opt-out,
which may work, but I trust the Smart Money article and internal
address more. So, now that I've had a chance to cross reference
this stuff, I'm gonna give it a shot tonight. In a few months, I'll
try to remember to post a follow up.
