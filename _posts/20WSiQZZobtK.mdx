title: Journaling To Slow Down Time
type: post
---

Writing these journals slows down time. 

Or, they at least give me a fighting chance to see time progress. Looking at the calendar date at the start of each day helps keep track of one day going into the next (even though so little changes). I still struggle with the day of the week. Soooooo, let's add this:

Monday, Oct. 12, 2020

New Text Expander snipper there to see the day along with the date. I just type "ddate;" and it automatically converts to the current date in that format. 

Pretty solid. 

Wish there was a say to stamp that at the start of each entry automatically. Unfortunately, my journal software doesn't do that. Not that big a deal. Getting into the habit of adding it won't be hard.
