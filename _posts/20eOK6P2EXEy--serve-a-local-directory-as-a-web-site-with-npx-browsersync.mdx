title: Serve A Local Directory As A Web Site With npx browser-sync

You can serve a local directory as a web site by running this inside it:

```command
npx browser-sync start --server --files "./*.html" --no-open --no-notify --directory
```

This will only server html files. Serving different ones is left as an exercise to the reader.

The site is served at both:

```
http://localhost:3000
http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:3000
```

Use ngrok if you need to show it to folks externally by running this (doesn't have to be in the same directory):

```command
ngrok http 3000
```

There's also a UI that gives you some details at:

```
http://localhost:3001
http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:3001
```

You'll need `npx` installed which should come with node. 

It'll install browser-sync the first time you run it if it's not already there.
