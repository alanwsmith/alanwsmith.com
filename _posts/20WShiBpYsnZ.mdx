title: Remote Control Storage Solution Mod
type: post

Remote controls are amazingly good at being in the wrong place. Either in the way, or nowhere to be found. After decades of research, I've determined the problem isn't the remotes. It's the furniture. Designed before the invention of electronics, it hasn't evolved to accommodate them.

Until furniture design catches up, a few power-tools and some surplus wood flooring can provide a nice modification/solution. Introducing: Custom Remote Storage Nooks.

Besides tools and materials, the only ingredient necessary is willingness to make sawdust from your furniture.

It's clear looking at the underside that the nooks are post-purchase mods. Few people will ever see that. Those that do will be admiring your handiwork.

From start to finish, the mod took half a day. A fun little weekend project that neatly solves one of life's little annoyances.
