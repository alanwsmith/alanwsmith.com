I wonder what the defining moments in history will be for future generations. 

I'm sure I'lll have as vivid a recollection of the Sept. 11 planes crashing into the World Trade Center towers as my folks did of the Kennedy assassination. Probably more so thanks to the relentless news. 

I'm almost afraid to think about what the moments that will burn themselves into the memories of the next and
future generations will be. Mainly, I just hope that my friend at work is wrong. He thinks he'll live to see a nuclear bomb be used inside the U.S. 

Obviously, I really hope he's wrong. Both for the initial lose of life but also for the destruction that would surely rain down after. (A darker thought than I normally post, but it's been on my mind more recently than normal.)
