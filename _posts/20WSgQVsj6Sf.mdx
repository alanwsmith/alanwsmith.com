I saw [Dilert](http://dilbert.com/) a few times when I was in
College. Didn't find it funny at all. I now work in a fairly
corporate environment and find it funny way more often than not.
This is one from the other day that I really enjoyed.

Since I'm the tech guy and the majority of what I work on is Greek
to the rest of the staff, I figured it would be a good one to print
out and stick on my door. It's probably obvious, but I should point
out that "Framistan" and "Gabol" are made up terms. This also
reminds me of some people that I've worked with before that
pretended to know a lot more about technology than they actually
did. I would occasionally make up fake technology terms or
abbreviations, combine them with real terms and ask things like,
"You know how Rapid-Q2 XML delivery works, right?" The answer would
invariably be "Of Course!" with a bit of that tone that implies
insult by asking such a silly question. Neat trick since Rapid-Q2
isn't anything.
