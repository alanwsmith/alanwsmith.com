I realized that doing streams is a lot like [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). Talking to the stream makes you think through things the same way you would to the duck (or, you know, to someone else.)

Also, I don't really use it for debugging, but instead of a duck, I have a [Memento Mori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori).

Notes from the stream:

- Running PHP in MAMP, you can use this to launch a file in whatever editor it's defaulted to:

```php{numberLines: true}
shell_exec('open /path/to/file/index.md');
```


- Here's the stuff I tried that didn't work:


```bash
	exec("'/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl' /Users/alans/woodshed/launchpad/html-prod");

	exec("python -c 'import os; os.system(\'/usr/local/bin/st\')'");

	$cmd = "python -c 'import os; os.system(\"open /Users/alans\")'";
	exec($cmd);

	$cmd = 'open "/Applications/Sublime Text.app"';
	exec($cmd);

	$cmd = "python -c 'import os; os.system(\"/usr/local/bin/st\")'";
	exec($cmd);
	
	$cmd = '"/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl"';
	exec($cmd);

	shell_exec('/bin/bash -c open .');	

```

This is a great piece of code from stackify that setups up so you can send php messages to the console. 

https://stackify.com/how-to-log-to-console-in-php/

```php{numberLines: true}
<?php
function console_log($output, $with_script_tags = true) {
    $js_code = 'console.log(' . json_encode($output, JSON_HEX_TAG) . 
');';
    if ($with_script_tags) {
        $js_code = '<script>' . $js_code . '</script>';
    }
    echo $js_code;
}
```


- The final thing is that I ended up using parse-url instead of split based on feedback in chat. It's good stuff: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.parse-url.php
