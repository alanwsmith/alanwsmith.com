First off, standard UUIDs are 36 characters (32 hex characters plus for dashes)


From the docs: If all you want is a unique ID, you should probably call uuid1() or uuid4(). Note that uuid1() may compromise privacy since it creates a UUID containing the computerâ€™s network address. uuid4() creates a random UUID.

So, 

```python3
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import uuid

my_uuid = str(uuid.uuid4())

print(my_uuid)
```

Note that the value is a UUID object, but it converts to a string when printed. In this case, We're making the move explicitly
