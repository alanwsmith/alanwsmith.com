I deciede to send some stuff into
[Cool Tools](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/). Since I love seeing
what comes up on that site I figured I should contribute as well.
I've only sent two things in and they picked up the second one. The
[Smart Drive 2002](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001151.php).
This kinda has me wanting to try and get something some of the
other sites I frequent like
[BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/).
