If you haven't already heard about Microsoft's Songsmith, you can
check out the the official
[Microsoft Research Songsmith](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/songsmith/)
page for a quick video about it. Basically, you feed it vocals and
it comes up with music for you. I thought it was a joke when I
first saw it, but it's real. Several folks around the net have
taken to feeding it the vocal tracks from popular songs and seeing
what it comes up with. Everyone I have heard has been universally
bad. Some have been at least entertaining, but a few actually like
[Running with the Devil](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY-2nI494fs)
actually hurt my brain a little. Another example that isn't quite
as bad is this version of The Police's "Roxanne":
While it doesn't cause physical pain, it seems to go on forever.
Normally, Roxanne isn't that long a song. With the Robo-Latin beat
produced by Songsmith, Microsoft has managed to find a way to slow
time.
