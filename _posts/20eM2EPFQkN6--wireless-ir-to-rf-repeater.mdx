title: Wireless IR to RF repeater
---

I've become a decent fan of the wireless TTL that is in canon's
flashes these days (assuming you have at least one expensive one
that can act as a master). However, it is a very limited system. I
had an assistant with me at the wedding last weekend and was trying
to use a slave on a monopod that he was carrying for some shots. It
was very inconsistent. Even when we were indoors and he was only a
few feet away from me if everything wasn't lined up just right, his
strobe wouldn't trigger. I ended up going back to a previous setup
where I attach two strobes directly to my bracket. One pointing at
the subject and the second one pointing up to provide a bounce off
the ceiling (when appropriate). I'll post some images of the result
after the bride has seen them. In the past I've used pocket wizards
for this type of stuff but they don't provide the benefits of TTL.
So, you either have to set them manually or run with them judging
the exposure themselves. I almost always went with the latter in
the film days, but with the clipping that can occur in digital I'm
nervous to go that route. This lead me back to thinking about a way
to run radio wireless instead of the built in IR. One way would be
to try to create a hot shoe that reads the instructions from the
camera and then map the IR signals and try to clone. Another way
that I just thought of would be to create an RF repeater. The basic
idea is to create a little RF transceiver that goes in front of the
IR ports on the canon strobes. It would simply capture the IR
signals then convert them to RF for transmission to the other unit
where it would be received and transposed back into IR. Seems like
it should be possible even if the timing and communication is a bit
tricky. Of course, this could also be setup to play nice with my
master wireless controller described at the bottom of
