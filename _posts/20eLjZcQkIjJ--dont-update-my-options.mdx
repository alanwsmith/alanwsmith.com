title: Dont Update My Options

It pisses me off when you update a piece of software and it chooses
to ignore options that you have set before. I just upgraded the
Yahoo Music Engine. Before I made the update I turned off the
option that automatically starts it up when the computer starts up.
The update of teh software turns that option back on. I know it's
not a case of resetting all the options to a default setting
because it kept track of other customizations I set. I set up my
computer the way I want it to work. Please don't screw with that.
If you pile on enough little annoyances like that I'll drop your
product.
