title: Resize tmux Window Panes On A Mac
type: post

### TL;DR

Uses these key sequences to resize tmux window panes on a mac:


```command
CTRL+b :resize-p -D 4
CTRL+b :resize-p -U 4
CTRL+b :resize-p -L 4
CTRL+b :resize-p -R 4
```


### Details


The `CTRL+b ARROW` (aka `<C-b> + ARROW) calls don't work on my mac. There are system command that take over and prevent them from working. To resize window panes, I use the tmux command line

- First hit CTRL+b 
- Then hit `:` to move to the command line
- Use `resize-p` to change the window pane size with the direction and the amount. For example:
    
        :resize-p -D 4

The `-D` stands for down and the "4" is the amount. The other directions are `-U` for up, `-L` for left, and `-R` for right.
