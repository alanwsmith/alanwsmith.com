There has been an increasing trend of video used for posts on the
web recently. Often, this is taking the "embed" code and putting a
video from youTube or a youTube clone on another site. This easy
clipping of content continues to filter out as more and more people
see clips they like and copy them over. For the most part, these
don't require any work. It's just a simple copy and paste job.
Then, there's folks who talk the source video and clip and
reassemble themselves to create a new peice of content. Call it
Remix, Mashup or whatever, this type of clipping can also provide
some very entertaining results. Two examples are below. In case you
haven't seen The Sopranos and don't get the meaning of uncensored,
you now have fair warning that there is a lot of dialog that's not
safe for the office. In fact, damn near all of it is considering
the clip is billed as every curse word from every episode of the
show.

Kudos to the folks who put these together for taking the time to do
it. They have much more patients than I.
