I took the recently converted to Infrared 10D out to a bar last
night to start putting it through its paces with a little band
photography. When I have a chance I'll do a write up about
everything, but one of the key points is that the flash setup
worked pretty much as expected. For example:
![Infrared band trail run photo 1](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/20060805-011554-01.jpg "Infrared band trail run photo 1")
What was surprising, was that for the most part, I didn't actually
need the flash. The lights weren't that bright (and I forgot to get
an actual meter reading), but apparently the stage lights put out a
ton of IR and the color gels don't block it much at all. This makes
sense now that I think about because stage lights naturally get
really hot. My guess is the gels are specifically designed to allow
Infrared to pass to help keep them from getting even hotter.
Anyway, this was shot at ISO 800 - f/5.0 at 1/80 sec.

The meter in the camera was saying that it was greater than 2 stops
under exposed. Hopefully, I'll remember next time to actually get
an accurate visible light meter reading for comparison sake.
Anyway, I'll be posting more when I've had a chance to edit them
down and get a full write-up to push to the world for prosperity's
sake.
