Front and back view of my pin hole body cap. The foil is taped on
the inside. I should be able to use the body cap pretty much as
normal. Of course, I almost never use them preferring to keep a
wide lens on the body.

And here is a shot of the outside of my office at lunch time.
Shutter speed metered out to 8 seconds at ISO 100. (David had it
right about needing to block out the viewfinder while metering to
prevent light leak.)  
If my math is right, based off the Sunny 16 Rule the pin hole works
out to F/512. That's half a gig of aperture. Wait. I'm mixing
analog and digital terminology again.

(And, yes. I need to clean the sensor on my camera to get rid of
the specks.)
