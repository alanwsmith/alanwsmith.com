title: Load Custom Function Files
slug: 20eOYszmkGQ0--load-custom-function-files
---

I'm keeping all my custom functions in individual files in a `~/.zsh-functions` directory. I load them in my `~/.zshrc` file with:

```
if [ -d $HOME/.zsh-functions ] 
then 
  for file in $HOME/.zsh-functions/*.zsh
  do 
    source "$file"
  done
fi 
```
