Just got an
[HP LaserJet 1020](http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF05a/18972-236251-236263-14638-f51-439423.html)
printer. A huge portion of the stuff I print is just for the text.
Articles, receptings from online purchases, documentation, etc... I
got fed up with how long it takes to print this stuff on my Epson
Photo printer and the cost of ink. I'm very impressed with the HP.
It is very fast, not horribly loud and the toner is considerably
less expensive per printed page. I also like the actual output more
as well. Text just looks crisper and I'm not worried about it
fading. Newegg happend to have it on sale the day I went to buy it
for $120 including shipping. I'm already pleased with the purchase
and I'll probably save that much from the reduce opperating cost in
the first year. Two thumbs up.
