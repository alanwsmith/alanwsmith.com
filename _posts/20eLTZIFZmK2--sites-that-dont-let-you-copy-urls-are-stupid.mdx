I'm making a little bit of a wish list and one of the things on it
is a
[Craftsman Ratcheting Screwdriver](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001049.php).
The link to the sears site on that page works, but I did a little
bouncing around and then tried to copy the URL to paste into my
wish list. The link that I got was
[this one](http://www.sears.com/sr/javasr/product.do?BV_SessionID=@@@@1266365478.1134442216@@@@&BV_EngineID=ccgdaddghhgdikecegecegjdghldfom.0&pid=00941796000&bidsite=&vertical=TOOL&ihtoken=1).
The only problem is that if you try to go back to it, the page
tells you that you have to start over from the beginning. That's a
horrible experience to make a customer go through. If I want to buy
something from your store and I know exactly where it is but need
to come back to complete the purchase later don't move the damn
thing on me. Some people will go through the process of finding it
again, but you are going to lose some sales and just frustrate most
people in general.
