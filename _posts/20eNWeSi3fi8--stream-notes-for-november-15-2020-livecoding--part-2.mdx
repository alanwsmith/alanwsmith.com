### Notes

GOAL: Figure out how to use "entry points" and pipx to install a python script as a command line too. 

Got it to work... Mostly. I've got the file installing and working when I don't call any external files. As soon as I do that, it errors out. 

I'm still surprised that I haven't hit on direct documentation for this stuff yet. Makes me think that folks must not do it very much. But, I wonder if part of that is because it's not well documented. A self-re-enforcing circle.
