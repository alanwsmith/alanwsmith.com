David is in the process of setting up a light kit using ever
reliable vivitar 283 flashes. I think I've mentioned before that a
285 was my main strobe for several years. I've always used these
flashes with their Auto setting where the flash figures out how
much light it thinks the scene needs the provides that amount and
cuts itself off. Whit David's talk of setting up the kit, I got to
wondering if there was a way to control the light output so that
you could have a consistent, controllable light burst. The goal
being, for example, to setup two 283s pointed at umbrellas and dial
one back a stop less than the other. A quick google and I found
[this page](http://www.hiviz.com/activities/guidebook/Activity_02.html)
on high speed flash photography. While the topic is a little
different, the solution looks like it'll work like a champ. The
salient point on that page is \#5. On a Vivitar 283, remove the
Auto-thyristor module and plug a 100 k ohm varialbe resistor in the
right two holes (as you are facing the strobe). You should then be
able to dial in the amount of light you want the strobe to release
with each flash. (I haven't tried this yet, but will soon. If you
beat me to it, let me know if anything explodes.) If this works, as
I expect it will, I'm gonna end up buying a bunch of 283s. This
will also make it easy for me to set them up someday when I start
doing my infrared band photography.
