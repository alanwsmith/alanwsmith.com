### [Start: 00:00:00] - Review

Started off with a little review of the process and how we got here. 

### [Time: 00:12:05] - Links to Sublime Text 2 from hugo drafts site. 

I setup links on the local version of my Hugo site to open drafts in Sublime Text 3. I realized I want to be able to open them in Sublime Text 2 sometime. Made a quick detour to get that going. 

The original links uses the basic `open` command with no flags which worked because my system is setup to open `.md` files with Sublime Text 3. In order to get files to open with a different app, I had to pass the `-a` flag to `open` which tells it which app to use. 

Here's the code:

```bash
shell_exec("open -a '/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app' /Users/alans/woodshed/alanwsmith.com/prod/content/2-quarts/index.md");
shell_exec("osascript -e 'tell application \"Sublime Text 2\" to activate'");
```

This is one of those things where it was a little annoyance, but instead of continuing to be annoyed, I wrote a little code to make the annoyance go away.


### [Time: 00:33:40] - Back to Django

Just making more progress here with Django testing and hooking pages up to the database for output. 


### Table Of Contents

- [Part 1](/stream-notes-2020-10-06/) - Getting the home page to work

- [Part 3](/stream-notes-2020-10-09/) - Learning how to test. And, making a python module so that unittest's output is green instead of red when tests pass. 
- [Part 4](/stream-notes-2020-10-10/) - More progress with testing and getting database content to show up. (Also, updating my local Hugo site to launch into either Sublime Text 2, or Sublime Text 3.)
- [Part 5](/stream-notes-2020-10-10-2/) - Working with forms and getting a pointer to generic views.
- [Part 6](/stream-notes-2020-10-11/) - Review run-through and adding URLs.
