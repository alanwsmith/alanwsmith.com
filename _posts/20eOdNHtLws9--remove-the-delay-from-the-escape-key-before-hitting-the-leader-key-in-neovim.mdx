This looks like what got the fix in place:

```
set timeoutlen=1000 ttimeoutlen=10
```

This is from the main page: https://www.johnhawthorn.com/2012/09/vi-escape-delays/

TODO: Link in the tmux stuff as well. 


look at `:help timeout`


link to post about tmux setting the timeout there




TODO:

From here: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Parameters.html#Parameters-Used-By-The-Shell-1

KEYTIMEOUT
The time the shell waits, in hundredths of seconds, for another key to be pressed when reading bound multi-character sequences.

Check to see if that has any effect on nvim
