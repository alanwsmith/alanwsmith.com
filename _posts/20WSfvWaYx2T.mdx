title: Launchy - quick launch app for Windows

Found this one via [Life hacker](http://lifehacker.com/). The
program is [Launchy](http://www.launchy.net/). It's a keyboard
quick launcher for windows. The default way to bring it up is by
holding down the "Alt" key and hitting the space bar. It pops up
and presents you with a text cursor. From there, you start typing
the name of the application you want to launch. Usually withing a
two or three letters, it'll have what you want and show you its
icon. Then just hit "Enter" and the app launches. If you already
have your hands on the keyboard, it is much faster than taking one
off, grabbing your mouse and searching thru you quick launch bar or
under your start menu. Takes a little getting used to, but if you
jump around as often as I seem to between software it's very handy.
