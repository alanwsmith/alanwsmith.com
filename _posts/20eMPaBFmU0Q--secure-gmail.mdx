When I first started using gmail, there wasn't a setting to secure
it, but you could do it manually by changing the first "http://"
part of an address to "https://". Now, Google has a setting that
you can do this with and enforce it. Under "Settings" look for
"Browser connection:" and make sure it's set to "Always use https".
If you use Gmail, you should check this now. Like, right now. It's
always been possible for people to easily get into your account if
you don't use the encryption, but now someone is about to
[release a tool to the public](http://www.webmonkey.com/blog/Why_You_Should_Turn_Gmail_s_SSL_Feature_On_Now)
that does it automatically. Computer security can be complicated,
but this is a VERY easy fix now that google has provided the
setting. Make sure you take advantage of it.
