Eric Clapton's version of "Cocaine" came on the radio the
yesterday. I don't often listen to the radio (thank to my mp3
player) and I hadn't heard the song in a long time. For whatever
reason, it triggered a memory of the first time I remember hearing
the song. I was in probably 6th grade and we were watching an
anti-drug video in the gym one day. The video was trying to point
out how bad drugs were and at one point talked about how you had to
be on guard because there were songs that would try to convince you
to use. To illustrate the point, they played a few bars of Cocaine
while highlighting the lyrics on the screen. The point of all this
was to show how dangerous the music was, but I distinctly remember
thinking, "wow, I really like that music". Kinda blew their point
saying that both drugs and the music were bad when my reaction to
the music was that I thought it was really good off the bat. That's
the first time I can remember consciously questioning what I was
being told by "The Man". (For those of you who are wondering, No
I've never done cocaine.)
