TODO: Figure out why this isn't working in MDX


I don't frequent clubs but ended up at one last night called TSI<sup>1</sup>. There's some nice lighting in there.

I shot these with my Canon S100<sup>2</sup>. I was just messing around last night, but now I want to go back and shoot for real. Time to go buy some glow sticks.

_Links and Notes_

1. [Club TSI](http://www.clubtsi.com/) - According to their website: North Florida's Premiere Dance Club. I don't have anywhere near enough knowledge on the subject to know if that's true. I _can_ say the light show is well done. 

2. [Canon S100](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005MTME3U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005MTME3U&linkCode=as2&tag=tioa-20) - My current everyday carry camera. If you're looking for a point and shoot, I can vouch for this one. It's great.
