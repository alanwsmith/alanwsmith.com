title: Frog Portrait

Found this little guy when I was leaving the office one night and decided to shoot a few portraits with my little point and shoot camera.

<Img src="frog_portrait_20080402_snaps_0008" alt="Portrait of a frog from very close up" />

A couple times I got too close and he did this:

Note: in this shot he was facing the other direction from the portrait above. I probably couldn't get that shot again with a point and shoot if I tried 1,000 times. I think would fall into what Henri Cartier-Bresson calls
[The Decisive Moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Cartier-Bresson#The_Decisive_Moment).

From the Wikipedia article:

> "Photography is not like painting," Cartier-Bresson told the Washington Post in 1957. "There is a creative fraction of a second when you are taking a picture. Your eye must see a composition or an expression that life itself offers you, and you must know with intuition when to click the camera. 
> 
> That is the moment the photographer is creative," he said. "Oop! The Moment! Once you miss it, it is gone forever."
