Haven't noticed this before, but I pulled up beside a cement truck
the other day and saw this on their tires:
![Cement Truck](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/20060227_093946a.jpg "Cement Truck")
I'm gussing the driver can actually control the pressure in the
tires to depending on how much cement is in the mixer. I wonder how
much weight those tires can support. The concept of a ton is hard
for me to grasp.
