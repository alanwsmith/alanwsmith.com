There is a local radio show called Music from the Electro Lounge
that I listen to a lot on the local NPR station. Tonight they are
doing and 80s edition with music and some interspersed audio clips.
One of the clips was the announcement of the assassination attempt
of President Reagan. This, got me thinking about the book my dad
wrote with/about Dennis McCarthy. I remember him as "Denny" who was
one of my dad's friends when we lived in D.C. He was also the
Secret Service agent who tackled Hinckley when he fired on Reagan.
Anyway, I pulled down a copy of the book and just flipped thru it
for a sec. On the dust cover is a bio for my dad: Philip W. Smith
was born in Fayetteville, Tennessee, and attended the University of
Southern Mississippi for one year before joining the Huntsville
(Alabama) Times. In 1971 he became the paper's Washington
correspondent and spent the next twelve years in the capital
working for Newhouse Newspapers. He now lives in Huntsville,
Alabama, with his wife, Susan, and their ten-year-old son, Alan.
