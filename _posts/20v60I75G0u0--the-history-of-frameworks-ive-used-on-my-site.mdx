The progression:

- [hand coded html](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [hand coded perl](https://www.perl.org/)
- [hand coded php](https://www.php.net/)
- [blogspot/blogger](https://www.blogger.com/about/)
- [wordpress](https://wordpress.com/)
- [ruby on rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
- [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
- [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)

I also played with [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com/) and [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org/) at some point, but I can't remember if I actually switched the site to them.

It would have been cool to have marked down the years when I made the various switches. I didn't keep track of that though.

The biggest thing for me now is the move to [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for content. Reminds me of the original hand coding html days but on steroids. It feels like magic. 

I've got no problem considering other frameworks. But, anything that doesn't handle MDX is a non-starter.
