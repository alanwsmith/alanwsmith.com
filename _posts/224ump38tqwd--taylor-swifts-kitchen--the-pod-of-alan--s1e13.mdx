This episode hasn't been published yet. This is placeholder page. 

### Topics Include

- Artists liking their art isn't arrogant
- Samuel L. Jackson digs his stuff
- Related: I like my own podcasts
- The early learning loop. Make something, learn from it, remake it. Rinse, repeat.
- Artists in society


- This is the first one where I did the recording of the Audio directly in Audition. Might have peaked the meter once or twice.
