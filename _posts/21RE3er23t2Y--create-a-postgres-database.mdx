title: Create A Postgres Database
slug: /posts/21re3er23t2y--create-a-postgres-database
---

Connect to the main `postgres` database with a user that has create database privileges via:

```
psql -U user_name -d postgres
```

(Or, `psql postgres` if your setup for that)


Run:

```
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
```

The database is made from a clone of the `template1` database. So, any changes made there will show up in your new database.

NOTES:

You can check what permissions users have with `\du` when logged into the database
