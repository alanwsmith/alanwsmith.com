title: Create A Postgres Database
---

Log in to the server with user that has create database privileges via:

```
psql -U user_name
```

Run:

```
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
```

The database is made from a clone of the `template1` database. So, any changes made there will show up in your new database.
