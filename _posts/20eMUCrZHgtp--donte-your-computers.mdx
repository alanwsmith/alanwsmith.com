Quick link that I saw today for
[tips for donating your old computers](http://www.techsoup.org/learningcenter/hardware/page5496.cfm?cg=searchterms&sg=instructions%20for%20donors).
More importantly, a search tool where you can
[find places to donate computers based on zip code](http://www.techsoup.org/resources/index.cfm?action=resource.view_summary&resourcelist_id=144&style=recycle&set=products).
I've had problems finding places to donate gear to before, this
should help a lot. If you've got old gear, this is something you
should think about.
