Took it easy tonight and watched The Right Stuff. I had not seen it
before even though it was from 83. I wish I had seen it back then.
I thought it was okay, but didn't really like it that much. A lot
of the film had an 80s production feel to it that I just don't
like. Also, having just seen The Aviator a couple weeks ago the
standard has been moved up a few rungs. I would however like to
read the book someday (or listen to the audio version). The movie
did get me thinking though one thing I'm putting on my list is to
make it down to a shuttle launch. It really is amazing that we can
put people in space. What's even more amazing is that if technology
keeps accelerating the it has been recently I might even get a
chance to go myself. It's fun to imagine a time when space travel
is as old hat as airline travel is today. I don't think that's
likely to happened for a long time since the choice of destinations
is quite limited and likely to remain so for a good while.
