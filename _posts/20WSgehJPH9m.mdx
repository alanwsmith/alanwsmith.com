The video below has been making the rounds over the past few days.
It's a commercial for Durex condoms featuring condom/balloon
animals going at it.
It was created by a company called [Superfad](http://superfad.com/)
who have done a lot of other great work. For one, they created
"[outtakes](http://superfad.com/player.php?project=251&item=576)"
of the Durex commercial that are well worth a watch. More
impressive is their [reel](http://superfad.com/reel.php). It's got
some beautiful images in there and stands as a great example of why
we don't have much of a chance against commercials. I mean, when
stuff looks that cool, you'd have to be lacking a pulse not to be
influenced.

Excellent stuff.
