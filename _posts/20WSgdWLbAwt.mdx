An [excellent friend](http://simulatethis.blogspot.com/), who
happens to be in Japan right now, was the first one to tell me that
you can generally tell how good a book is going to be simply by
reading the first sentence. I just picked up
"[Ender's Game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender's_Game)" by
[Orson Scott Card](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card),
which starts:

"I've watched through his eyes, I've listened through his ears, and
I tell you he's the one. Or at least as close as we're going to
get."

Solid first by itself. Taken along with the tension created by the
second (and I think it's fair to take the two together) I judge it
a strong open.

(Incidentally, I haven't actually read the Wikipedia page on the
book. Since I'm starting the book, that would seem to be self
defeating. I'll the Wiki entry out after I'm finished with the
original text.)
