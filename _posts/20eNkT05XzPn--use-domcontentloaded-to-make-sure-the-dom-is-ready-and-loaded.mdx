title: Use DOMContentLoaded to make sure the DOM is ready and loaded
---

- The `DOMContentLoaded` event can be used to make sure the DOM is loaded. 
- Note that external resources like images may not be loaded at that point. 
- via: https://javascript.info/onload-ondomcontentloaded

Example:

```
<script>
    function blastOff() {
        console.log("blastOff")
    }
        
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", blastOff);
</script>
```
    
    
You can also do it with an anonymous funciton:


```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    console.log("DOMContentLoaded")
});
```
