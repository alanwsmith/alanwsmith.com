title: Refined Communication
---

I deal with a lot of little things in my gig. I expect lots of
folks do. Often, after I take care of one of these little things
for someone, the following instant messenger exchange takes place.
Other Person: thx. Me: np. Musing on the nature of communication,
this is coming very close to the minimimal amount of time and
effort needed to have that specific conversation. Most of the time,
it's not necessary for the person to respond, but it's always nice
form. Lots of times, this will actually take place after I
responded to them in an e-mail. I like this, since it's a quick hit
and helps keep my inbox clean. Of course, we could refine it to:
Other Person:ty Me: np I think thx works a little better visually
and it's only an extra byte of data...
