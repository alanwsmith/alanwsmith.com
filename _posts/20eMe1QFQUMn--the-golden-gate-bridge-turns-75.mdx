title: The Golden Gate Bridge Turns 75
---

The Golden Gate Bridge turned 75 yesterday. I was completely oblivious to this fact until the day before. As luck would have it, I'm in San Francisco. After a day of touring, I setup for some shots of the celebration's fireworks.

Shooting fireworks is always fun. Since this is also Memorial Day weekend, the fireworks make a nice tribute as well.
