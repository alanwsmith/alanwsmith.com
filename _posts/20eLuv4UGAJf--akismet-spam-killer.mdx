I've been having some problems with spam getting in thru the
comments on my wordpress blog. I tried a couple
[CAPTCAH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha) tools but they
didn't work. (I didn't have a chance to dig in and figure out why.)
The recent versions of Wordpress come with a plug-in that's
pre-installed called [Akismet](http://akismet.com/). Basically,
when you turn it on, it compares incoming comments on your blog
with those that other users have flagged as Spam. If it matches,
the comment gets put in a holding cell. You need to regeister a
username/password on wordpress.org to use it, but that's not big
deal. So far, it works great. I just installed it the other day and
it's already caught 11. Because it gets input from users of the
tool, it should update pretty quickly to any new spam. So far, so
good.
