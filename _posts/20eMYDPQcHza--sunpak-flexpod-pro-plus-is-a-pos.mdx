title: Sunpak FlexPod Pro Plus is a POS
---

While planning a trip to photograph the launch of space shuttle
Discovery, I decided to it would be fun to try to shoot a little
video as well. To accomplish this, I purchased a Sunpak FlexPod Pro
Plus. One of those little gripper tripods that are designed to
clamp to things and provide a camera mount. The idea was that once
my main tripod was positioned, I'd just clamp this thing on to one
of the legs, mount my little point and shoot camera on it, flip it
to video mode and let it roll.

Nice idea, but as soon as I tried to warp the thing around the
tripod leg, one of its legs busted off.

I tried using gaffers tape to reattach, but wasn't comfortable it
would be stable enough to hold the camera still for the several
minutes that would be necessary. I ended up using another shorter
one that has a similar type of legs, but is only designed to sit on
something instead of attach to it. With no platform available to
rest it on, the ground was the best I could do. The video turned
out better than I expected in that "happy accident" way, but I
would have much rather had it taken from above the weeds instead of
in them.

When I returned the broken FlexPod, the guy at the camera store
asked me if I wanted to swap it out for another one. I suppose it's
possible that I got the one defective one they had, but as far as
I'm concerned it's just a crappy product. Needless to say, I got a
refund instead.

Time to get a
