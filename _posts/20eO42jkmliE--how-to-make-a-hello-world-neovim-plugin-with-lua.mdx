title: How To Make A Hello World Neovim Plugin With Lua
slug: /posts/20eo42jkmlie--how-to-make-a-hello-world-neovim-plugin-with-lua
---

### TL;DR

NOTE: I don't think this is the best way to do this. It uses VimScript as well as Lua and seems to do a weird dance. Probably more strightforward to call lua directly

I'm looking to build a Neovim plugin with Lua. I couldn't find an article with a simple example. Digging through the [docs](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html#lua-require-example) I was able to put this one together. Setting up these files will provide a new command:

```shell
:HelloNeovim
```

Running it will print `Hello, Neovim! This is Lua!` on the first line of the open document.


### The Files

### File: ~/.config/nvim/autoload/hello_neovim.vim


    function hello_neovim#print_it()
    	call setline(1, luaeval('require("hello_neovim").hello'))
    endfunction



### File: ~/.config/nvim/lua/hello_neovim.lua


    return {
    	hello = "Hello, Neovim! This is Lua!"
    }



### File: ~/.config/nvim/plugin/hello_neovim.vim


    if exists('g:hello_neovim_loaded')
    	finish
    endif
    let g:hello_neovim_loaded = 1
    
    command HelloNeovim :call hello_neovim#print_it()



### Notes


The main tutorial that comes in the search results for making a neovim plugin with lua is [this one](https://www.2n.pl/blog/how-to-write-neovim-plugins-in-lua). It's 153 lines of code, creates windows with borders, uses git calls, and doesn't show you how to actually install it. I wasn't able to follow it. 



I think there's a way to isolate plugins during development, but I haven't figure that out yet.
