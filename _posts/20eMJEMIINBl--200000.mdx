Last Wednesday, April 2, 2008, just before I pulled into my neighborhood, my car turned 200,000 miles.

Speaks well for Toyota. 

I replaced the timing belt at 80,000 and 160,000 miles and had a few other moderate repairs. Other than that, all I really did was go through oil changes and tires. I knew I wanted to see if the little car could make it 200,000. Now I have to figure out if I want to have some work done of finally get a new car. 

We'll see....
