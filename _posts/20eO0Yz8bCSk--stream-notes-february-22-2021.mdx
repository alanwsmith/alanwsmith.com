### Notes

Continuation from the last stream. Got pointed to a new direction by [Chris Biscardi](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/)

Instead of trying to pass counters back and forth between parent and child components, I'm just keeping everything in the parent and passing content down. Works like a champ.
