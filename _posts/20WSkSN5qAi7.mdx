title: Use npm init To Create New Node Projects
type: post
---

This gets skipped in some articles, to create a basic node project, once you have `node` installed, run:

```bash
mkdir new_project_name
cd new_project_name
npm init
```

(And, yes, you use `npm` instead of `node` even though `node` is what's used to run it)


That will walk you through a series of questions to complete the setup which makes a `package.json` file

From there, use `npm i` to install modules. For example, install puppeteer with:

```bash
npm i puppeteer
```
