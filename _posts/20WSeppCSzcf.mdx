If you need an FTP client [try FileZilla](http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/). 
It's open source so it's free. There is also a FileZilla server if you need
to setup an FTP server on your machine. I've done this before to
make it easier to share files across a network between linux, mac
and windows machines. Worked like a charm.
