Video product demos are such a good idea. Compared to reading a few
bullet points, seeing a thumbnail image and maybe a slightly larger
photo, the marketing power of video demos is tremendous. Unless you
are buying a piece of art, you're almost certainly going to have
physical interaction with whatever you're buying. Seeing a video of
someone interacting with the item provides a wealth of information
that is much harder or even impossible to convey using only still
images and text. [B&H Photo](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/) has
started to figure this out. While browsing their catalog for new
light stands, I noticed this
"[View Demo](http://www.video.bhphotovideo.com/?skin=oneclip&autoplay=true&fr_story=FRdamp332427)"
link that provides a video overview of some of their Impact brand
products. It's a good start, but there is still some room for
improvement. For example, I'd like to see videos for individual
products where they are actually being used. As a consumer, I want
as much info as I can get about products I'm interested in. This is
true in the real world and doubly so when shopping online. I may
not use it all, but if you haven't answered all my questions, I'm
less likely to buy. On the other hand, if you show me a video of
basically everything the product can do and how to do it, my
comfort level goes way up and so will the likelihood that I'm going
to buy it.

Video production and delivery is now well within the reach of even
the smallest of businesses. Compared to the cost to produce and air
a television commercial, a web demo costs peanuts. If you take my
experience of seeing the video when I was searching for that type
of product you see the extra benefit gained based on my state of
mind. I was literally looking to make a purchase and then I found
extra info about something I was already thinking about buying. The
video was helpful instead of being an annoyance that was
interrupting the football game on TV. I expect we'll be seeing more
of this type of demo from across the market. First, from people and
business that "get it". Long term, I see it becoming the norm.
Longer term, these demos have the possibility of approaching the
impact of commercials on TV.
