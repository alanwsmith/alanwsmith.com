title: Requiring One and Only One Argument In A Bash Function
slug: /posts/20eo2xld7luk--requiring-one-and-only-one-argument-in-a-bash-function
---

This is an example function you can add to your .rc files that requires exactly one argument to run. It checks to make sure there's an argument in slot `$1` otherwise it bails. Once it's past that check, it checks to see if an extra argument was passed in slot `$2` and bails if that's the case.

Quotes can be used if you need an argument with spaces in it (e.g. `my_command "roll tide").

```bash
function my_command () {
    if [ "$1" ]
    then
        if [ "$2" ]
        then
            echo "You passed too many arguments"
        else
            echo "Got: $1 - Do Stuff Here"
        fi
    else
        echo "You need to pass an argument"
    fi
}
```
