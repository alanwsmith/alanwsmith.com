Took me a bit to figure this one out. This is how to get it installed so you can hit it from your command line. (NOTE: I've got `go` installed. I'm not sure if that's necessary or not. Your milage may vary.)

The install command to run is:

```cli
go install github.com/segmentio/ksuid/cmd/ksuid@latest
```

That installs the app on your `$GOPATH` which is not a regular environmental variable. It's also not a location that's on your PATH by default. You find it with:

```
go env GOPATH
```

That defaults to a `go` directory in your home directory. Wherever it points, the executable is in the `...go/bin` folder. Copy that into `/usr/local/bin` with something like:

```
cp ~/go/bin/ksuid /usr/local/bin
```

And, that should do it.
