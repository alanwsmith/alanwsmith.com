Hattie Sue Waggoner Jones, 98, died on Monday, September 10 at Lincoln Care Center in Fayetteville, TN. A native of Lynchburg, TN and graduate of Moore County High School, she lived there until moving to Fayetteville in 1932. She worked with Dr. Robert McCown, making house calls with him and assisting in the home deliveries of several babies in the late 1930's. 

Hattie Sue married Earle Hopkins Jones, Jr., in 1940 and they moved a few months later to Washington, DC, where they remained for nearly 50 years. Their daughter and son were both born and grew up in the DC area. She worked part-time in the offices of two physicians in the Virginia suburbs of DC while her children were growing up. In 1989 she and her husband returned to Fayetteville, where they enjoyed church and family activities. Her husband died in March 2005, shortly after they observed their 65th wedding anniversary. At the time of her death, Hattie Sue was the oldest female member of Fayetteville First Presbyterian Church. 

Memorial donations may be made to the Good Samaritan Association, 208 W. Davidson Street, Fayetteville, TN 37334 or to Macular Degeneration Research, PO Box 1952, Clarksburg, MD 20871.
