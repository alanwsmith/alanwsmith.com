I'm watching "All the Presidents Men" about the Watergate break-in.
There is a quote in the movie about Nixon's chief council that
talks about a cartoon on his wall that reads: "When you got them by
the balls, their hearts and minds will follow" Makes me wonder if
this was an unspoken part of the military's "Hearts and Minds"
campaign in Iraq.
