title: Using your phone with a small business
---

There are some simple things that you should do if you have a small
business. Answering and the phone well is way up the list.  
I going to have my house pressure washed as part of the process of
getting it ready to sell. So, I found a guys card at the bank. I'm
not sure how they worked a deal to get their literature at a bank,
but it worked out good for me. Anyways, I call the number on the
card and after 5 rings just before I was about to hang up someone
picks up and says, "Hello".  
Me (not sure I called the right number): Ummmmm, is this The
Pressure Washing Company?  
Him: Yep.  
Just, "Yep". Now, for all I know these guys may be the best in the
business, but in those few seconds my first impression of them is
that they don't really know what they are doing.  
If you have a small business, take a cue from big business and
answer your phone in the most professional manner possible. While
image may not be as important in the pressure washing business as
it is in, say, a photography studio, it still has an impact. If you
aren't making that impact as positive as possible, you are doing
yourself a disservice.  
(To this guys credit, he did call me back to let me know that he
wasn't going to be able to make it by today like he had originally
expected. Some people I have dealt with would have let me figure
that out for myself.)
