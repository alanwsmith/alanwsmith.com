title: Installing Pygments In Jekyll
---

First off: it's Pygments, not pigments

Took me a minute to figure that out. 

I think pygments comes installed with jekyll by default. You just need to generate the style sheet with:

```
pygmentize -S default -f html > source/css/pygments/default.css
```

You can then copy and paste the code into your main CSS if you only want to use one. 

Then, in your documents do:

```
{% highlight python %}
... code ...
{% endhighlight %}
```

Should work pretty much out of the gate.
