title: Encrypt And Decrypt Files On A Mac With GPG
---


To encrypt a file, use:

    /usr/local/bin/gpg --armor --encrypt --yes -r self@localhost.localdomain {FILE_PATH}

To decrypt a file use:

    /usr/local/bin/gpg --decrypt {FILE_PATH}


_NOTE: I'm not sure if gpg is installed by default or if it's something from homebrew_
