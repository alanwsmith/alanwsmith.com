This is an example of how to work with google spreadsheets via the python sdk. The main code for auth and setup is split out to a separate file for aesthetics. 

### main_file.py

```python3
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sqlite3
import google_spreadsheets

token_path = '/Users/alans/Desktop/token.json'
credentials_path = '/Users/alans/Desktop/credentials.json'
spreadsheet_id = '1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgvE2upms'
spreadsheet_range = 'Class Data!A2:E'

widget = google_spreadsheets.get_widget(
            token_path=token_path, credentials_path=credentials_path
        )

data = widget.values().get(
            spreadsheetId=spreadsheet_id, range=spreadsheet_range
        ).execute()

values = data.get('values', [])

for row in values:
    print(f'Col 1: {row[0]} - Col 2: {row[1]}')
```

### google_spreadsheets.py

```python3
#!/usr/bin/env python3 

# - This is a connector to Google Sheets
# - You need credentails setup as described here:
#       https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials
# - The path to the credentials file is define in the script
#       that uses this file. A token_path is also required. That
#       file will be created via the auth flow if it doesn't
#       already exist
# - The auth flow opens a browser for part of it. That part
#       doesn't work with Safar as of Oct 2021. The solution
#       is to copy the URL and paste it manually into Chrome
#       to complete the flow
# - The scope here is just for the spreadsheets but other 
#       Google services can be setup as well

# You'll need these:
# pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib

import os.path
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials

SCOPES = [
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets"
]

def get_widget(*, token_path, credentials_path):
    creds = None
    if os.path.exists(token_path):
        creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file(
            token_path, SCOPES
        )
    if not creds or not creds.valid:
        if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:
            creds.refresh(Request())
        else:
            flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(
                credentials_path, SCOPES
            )
            print("NOTE: Safari has trouble with this. If you're using it, copy the URL by hand to Chrome.")
            creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)
        with open(token_path, 'w') as token:
            token.write(creds.to_json())
    service = build('sheets', 'v4', credentials=creds)
    return service.spreadsheets()
```

- You can see the example spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgvE2upms/edit#gid=0)
- For the range, the `Class Data` identifies the specific sheet of the spreadsheet
- The `!A2:E` identifies the column and row data to use. (Only a couple columns are used in the output even though more than that is pulled)

From:

Gotta get the credentials setup and downloaded and dropped into a file `credentials.json`

Need this:

```
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
```
