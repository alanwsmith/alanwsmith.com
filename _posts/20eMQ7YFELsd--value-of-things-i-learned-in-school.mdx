For me, it was my sophomore year in college instead of 11th grade. Also, I was never that good about doing my homework so I'm sure I had much fewer hours for that part of the graph. The usefulness of hacking around with [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl) on my own, though, is well represented. The other thing I would add to the graph is the semester of Typing I took in high school for an easy "A". I never would have thought that out of all the courses I took during school Typing would be the most useful.
