An amazing piece of tech in modern photography is the ability to
have wireless automatic TTL exposure control of multiple strobes.
The fact that the two flashes can communicate via pulses of light
and automatically determine their exposure so fast that you
effectively can't tell the difference between their communication
and the exposure burst in incredible. It's one of the most telling
signs for me of exactly how fast computer chips can work and I'm
sure the chips that make it work are an order of magnitude less
powerful than what's in everyday personal computers. Right now,
I've got two Canon flashes that I use in this setup with the master
on the camera and a slave setup somewhere else in the room. One of
the few drawbacks of the system is that when a flash is set to
slave mode its auto-focus assist lamp blinks every second or so.
This light is surprisingly bright, especially if it keeps hitting
you in the eye from less than a few yards. It also creates an
annoying blink on your subject if you happen to have it pointed
directly at whatever you are shooting. You can pivot the flash head
to try and get this to aim somewhere else, but in general it seems
to always end up being a distraction. The good news is that it
appears that you can cover the AF assist lamp and not affect the
wireless operation. For example:

It turns out that the wireless sensor is directly above the Canon
mark. Also, to give you an idea of how bright the assist lamp is,
the blue tape you see is actually two pieces of painters masking
tape with a piece of black paper in between and if you look
directly at the strobe you can still see the red blinking through
it.It takes a little getting used to and the user interface for
controlling the stobes leaves a lot to be desired, but if you spend
a little time to get through the learning curve it's a great tool
to add to the box.
