title: Learning Django By Making A Tutorial - Part 1
type: post

`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLDcoPLJcxA`

I spent a few hours working through the [official Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/) over the past week. I only made it halfway through. It just doesn't work for the way that I learn. (Check out the past few streams to see me getting frustrated with it.)

So, I'm going [Docendo Discimus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docendo_discimus) style. Learning by teaching. Or, in this case, making a tutorial. This is the first of a multi-part set of streams where I put stuff together. 

This session is of me getting a home page up and running (and learning lots in the process).

I'll post the entire tutorial when it's done. 

### Table Of Contents

- [Part 1](/stream-notes-2020-10-06/) - Getting the home page to work
- [Part 2](/stream-notes-2020-10-08/) - Reviewing the first draft and building a model, view, and url structure for a checklist page
- [Part 3](/stream-notes-2020-10-09/) - Learning how to test. And, making a python module so that unittest's output is green instead of red when tests pass. 
- [Part 4](/stream-notes-2020-10-10/) - More progress with testing and getting database content to show up. (Also, updating my local Hugo site to launch into either Sublime Text 2, or Sublime Text 3.)
- [Part 5](/stream-notes-2020-10-10-2/) - Working with forms and getting a pointer to generic views.
- [Part 6](/stream-notes-2020-10-11/) - Review run-through and adding URLs.
