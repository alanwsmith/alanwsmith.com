A buddy at work was talking about the movie Firefox which I'm
familiar with but don't think I've ever seen. He sent me
[this trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdnnZMyKpg4) on you
tube. A wonderful example of movie trailers form the early 80s.
Explosions, super serious but short dialog, sneaking around the
corner with a gun, a hell of a left hook, and that A-Team sounding
announcer guy. Awesome!
