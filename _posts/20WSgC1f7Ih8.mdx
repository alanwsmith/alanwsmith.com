I've seen a couple of references to this, but was hesitant to read
it. I'm glad I did. It's a post penned by an American Solder who
blogs from Iraq. It's the final post from his blog that he asked a
friend to post in the advent of his death.

Wild to think this is posted to the world. What a age we live in.
