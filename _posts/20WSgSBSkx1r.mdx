[![ACME Workhourse 1500 bag](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/acme-bag.jpg "ACME Reusable Bag")](http://www.reusablebags.com/store/acme-bags™-workhorse-style-1500-p-1.html)In
college, I took a seminar course on environmental studies. In
addition to the overall theoretical education, a fair amount of
practical advice was provided as well. One key point that always
stuck with me was that we should reuse bags when we shop instead of
carrying stuff home in the store provided bags only to thrown them
away after they are unpacked. The specific recommendation from the
course was to use one bigger cloth bag, like a small laundry bag,
for transport. I've tried this a few times and it never really
worked out. The volume was simply to big for the job at hand. The
bag could get too heavy very quickly and without some ability to
separate things, it was inevitable that a 2 liter bottle would
crush any loafs of bread. Enter
[reusablebags.com](http://www.reusablebags.com/). I heard about
these guys a few months back and was excited to check them out.
They sell a wide variety of bags for reuse. Most of them are geared
toward women with various designs and images on them, but
thankfully there is at least one that won't make guys fell
uncomfortable: the

The base price is about $8 per, but if you get 4 or more that price
drops to $7 per. Also, the have a

I really like. Especially when I've seen some similar type bags for
sale in grocery stores for just a few dollars each. What sold me on
the ACME bags was the fact that they were a little bigger and
didn't have logos all over them. Since I plan on having these for a
long time, I'm willing to pay a premium to not have company logos
and slogans on them. Originally, I got 4 bags, but I'm happy to
report that after using them for a little while, I'm getting four
more. Each bag holds probably twice as much as a standard plastic
shopping bag. I know they will hold four 2-liter soda bottles
easily. I don't necessarily recommend having them packed like that.
The bag doesn't have a problem with the weight, but it's a bit
heavy leaning over to pull them out of the car. I'm pretty sure
that I'm currently one of a very few people using these type bags
in my area. Every time I had them to a bagger and explain I want to
use them in lieu of their standard ones, the have that look like
they aren't really sure what's going on. It still takes me some
getting used to as well. I've taken to always throwing them back in
my car when I unpack them so they are always there. Much easier for
me than trying to remember to grab them before I make a run to the
store. I hope that other folks who see me using these bags decided
to get a set for themselves. I encourage everyone do to the same.
To add one more note about the cost, the good feeling that I get
every time I use them makes the price seem even more reasonable.
