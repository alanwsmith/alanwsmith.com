According to a wired blurb I was reading today there are 250 IMAX
theaters. I've been lucky in that all the towns I've lived in (with
the excpetion of my years in Tuscaloosa) have had a theater in
close proximity. Unfortunately, the one that I'm close to now is a
flat screen instead of the curved ones which are soooo much more
immersive. Still, very fun movie going experience.
