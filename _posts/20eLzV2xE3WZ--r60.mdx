We just got new laptops at work. This model is a ThinkPad R60. It's
not a super fast machine by todays standards, but it's really very
impressive. I'm going through the process of getting all my apps
installed and it got me to thinking about exactly how amazing these
things are, especially when connected to the internet. Even more so
when you do that on a wireless network. Once again I say, things
have come a long way since
[Mr. Gutenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg)
started moving his type around.
