The basic react and router tutorials doing work great for me. So, here's mine which just shows you all the stuff to put into each file. 


Start by running

```bash
npx create-react-app site
cd site
npm install react-router-dom@6
npm start
```

That'll get the router installed and spin up the dev version of the site. (Note that I use Prettier for formatting that removes ending semi-colons)

Change `src/index.js` from

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import './index.css'
import App from './App'
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals'

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
)

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals()
```

To:

```javascript


```
