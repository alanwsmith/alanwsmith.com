TODO: Fix the formatting of this post that got busted during the move to nextjs

```
This is how to do it in the front end:

``javascript
import {useRouter} from "next/router";

export default function Items() {
  const { query } = useRouter();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Items page</h1>
      <p>{query.id}</p>
      <p>{query.name}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
``

via: https://reactgo.com/next-get-query-params/

And this is how to do it in the api pages:

There's a `.query` object the comes down in requests to API routes. Use it like this:

``jsx
export default function handler(req, res) {
  const name = req.query["name"];
  res.status(200).send(`Hello, ${name}`);
}
``

Putting that in a file at 

``
./pages/api/hello.js
``

sets up so that a call to 

``
/api/hello?name=carl
``

returns

``
Hello, Carl
``

OLD NOTES

You don't need to do this for requests, but this is still useful if you have a URL in a string


Not sure if it needs more stuff, but this is how you're getting query params from a url

``jsx
const parse_url = new URL(req.url)
const streamerId = parseInt(parse_url.searchParams.get('streamerId'), 10)
``

need to look into why that part is `http` and not `https` and just generally get a better idea of how it works. 


This is the original thing. This has the host at the end of it, but if the first argument you pass to it has a full url, including the host, the second argument is ignored. 

``
const parse_url = new URL(req.url, `http://${req.headers.host}`)
``

Here's a note about URLs

url
A USVString or any other object with a stringifier — including, for example, an <a> or <area> element — that represents an absolute or relative URL. If url is a relative URL, base is required, and will be used as the base URL. If url is an absolute URL, a given base will be ignored.
base Optional
A USVString representing the base URL to use in cases where url is a relative URL. If not specified, it defaults to undefined.
