title: Making A New Post For My Site In Gatsby
slug: 20eOc03zVpTI--making-a-new-post-for-my-site-in-gatsby

This was the start of my process for making posts in Gatsby. As of Nov. 2021, I'm no longer using Gatsby. I'm using NextJS instead. 



To write a new post:

- Update `/Users/alans/workshop/www.alanwsmith.com--gatsby--v1/.env.development` to change:

        SITE_CONTENT_DIR=/Users/alans/workshop/test-content
    
    To:
    
        SITE_CONTENT_DIR=/Users/alans/workshop/site-content
        
        (Note: `site-content` not `source-content`)
        
        
        
- Make a new file under:

        /Users/alans/workshop/source-content/YEAR/SLUG/index.md
        
- Contents of the file should be:
