title: Recovering Deleted Photos
---

If you have ever formatted a compact flash card that had photos on
it you still needed, the first thing to do is make sure you don't
mess with the card at all. Then,  check out
[PhotoRec](http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec). An open source
tool that tries to recover photos that have been deleted. It's a
bit cryptic to use, but there is a step-by-step procedure in the
documentation that'll walk you thru it. I've used it once with
success to help get photos off a friends card.

If things get corrupted, there is also TestDisk, which is bundled
with PhotoRec. I haven't used it, but it's worth a shot if you run
into real issues with a card.

Other than being Free Open Source Software, these apps have the
added bonus of being available on multiple operating systems
including Mac and Windows.
