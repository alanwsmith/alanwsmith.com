title: Better Battery Meter

I went to the Jacksonville Sea & Sky Spectacular today and did some
shooting. I made over 300 exposures and was using the tracking
version of autofocus to drive a 300 and 80-200 lens most of the
time. It's rare that I pull that much juice from the batteries but
they lasted the day which I was quite happy about. I'd like to see
a better battery meter in the camera though to get a better idea of
how much juice I have left. The meter on my camera has just three
readings it can show: Full charge, partial charge and basically
dead. I'm not sure at what point the camera decides to move from
full to partial, it seemed to make that jump about 1/3 of the way
through the day. This made me quite nervous since I wasn't sure if
that meant that I only had 1/2 of a charge left. I slowed down on
the shooting at that point and did a lot more manual focusing to
try to save the battery. I'd like to see a meter that gives you an
estimation of the percentage left to, say, the nearest ten. This
would make it a lot easier to pace the shooting to make sure you
can last as long as you need if you don't have spare batteries with
you.
