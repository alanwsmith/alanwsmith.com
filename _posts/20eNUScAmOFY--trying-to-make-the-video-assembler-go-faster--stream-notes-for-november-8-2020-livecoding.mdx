### Notes

Updated the Automatic NASA Video Music Maker to try to speed it up a little by only making a single clip from each video. It's still sllllloooow. It's running though. Next step will be to put it on a few EC2 instances and see what kind of time they an produce. 

Another thing I could do is do a pre-clip of one part and only run scene detect on it. That's probably a good idea...
