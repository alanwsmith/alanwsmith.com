title: Holy Cow Juliette Lewis Rocks
---

I don't remember how I got there, probably one of those trips down
the Wikipedia Rabbit Hole, but I just recently stumbled on the fact
that Juliette Lewis is a signer. Unlike a lot of other actresses
that start "singing careers" to have another produce to sell,
Juliette looks like she's in it for the music and can damn well
carry a tune.

I figured all this out when I found a reference somewhere to
[Juliette and the Licks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliette_and_the_Licks).
Looks like I'm a little late to see them live. According to that
Wikipedia page, the band recently broke up and Juliette has moved
to a new group called "The New Romantiques". It looks like this
band is going to be much more about Juliette since the top result
in Google's search for the band points to
[www.myspace.com/juliettelewis](http://www.myspace.com/juliettelewis)
while the second result
[www.myspace.com/julietteandthenewromantiques](http://www.myspace.com/julietteandthenewromantiques)
is just a redirect to the /juliettelewis page. When you get there,
the branding is all about her and I don't see a mention of the
Romantiques anywhere.

There are also a few tracks on the MySpace page. They are alright,
but don't do a whole lot for me. I like the stuff I've heard from
when she was with the Licks a lot more. They were much more in that
good ol' rock and roll genre. For example, here's a produced
video:

But the real proof is in the Live pudding:

Girl can put on a show.

I've always thought that chicks who sing automatically get way
sexier. Juliette is further confirmation. I never thought she was
that attractive. At least, not until I saw her sing. Then she
jumped right into the "hot" category.

One final note, I can't help but think an old college buddy told me
about the her singing career a long time ago and I didn't take him
seriously. I hope my memory is playing tricks on me. If not, I owe
him a drink.
