title: Photos of Matt and Matt

Just posted the shots from last weekend. There were several that
didn't make the cut because of the newly discovered problem with
[back-focusing](http://anotheralan.blogspot.com/2005/10/badback-focus.html).
Still pissed about that.  
Anyway the shots were of
[Matt Wertz](http://www.alanwsmith.com/gallery/v/music/matt_wertz_2005_10_07/)
and
[Matt Nathanson](http://www.alanwsmith.com/gallery/v/music/matt_nathanson_2005_10_07/)
playing at Freebird Live. I got there as M. Wertz was finishing up
his show. There was another artist named Kate Earl, but she
finished up before I made it to the bar.  
I need to talk to the lighting guy and see if they would be willing
to point one of the spots a little farther back so it hits the
drummers. When they sit with their back to the wall, they are
basically in a black hole.
