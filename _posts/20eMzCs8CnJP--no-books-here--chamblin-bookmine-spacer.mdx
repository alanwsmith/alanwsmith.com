title: No Books Here - Chamblin Bookmine Spacer
---

At 23,000 square feet, Jacksonville Florida's [Chamblin Bookmine](http://www.chamblinbookmine.com/default.aspx) is one of the most impressive collections of books you'll ever see. Every square inch of wall space is filled with books.

Well, almost every square inch.
