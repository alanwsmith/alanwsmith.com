title: Generate A Random Hex Color In JavaScript
---

```javascript
const color = `#${Math.floor(Math.random() * 16777215)
  .toString(16)
  .padStart(6, '0')}`

console.log(color)
```

This is based off of the code on [this page](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/random-hex-color/) but adds `padStart` so that colors that would otherwise be less than six characters are padded properly. 


There are other approaches on the page as well if you're interested.
