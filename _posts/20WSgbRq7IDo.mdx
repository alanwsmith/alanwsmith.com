After several years of working on Windows XP machines, I've
recently made the switch back to Mac. The difference is profound
and makes me regret that I didn't push for the Mac a long time ago.
A rough analogy would be switching from a 1987
[Ford Taurus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1st_Ford_Taurus_GL_sedan.jpg)
to a brand new
[BMW M3](http://www.bmwusa.com/Standard/Content/Vehicles/2009/M/M3Coupe/default.aspx).
I build things that run on web sites and those sites all run on
[Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux). When I has to work on
a Windows machine, the only way I could really do development was
to use a
[Virtual Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Machine)
which let me effectively have a Linux server running "inside"
Windows. While this works, it means constantly jumping through a
lot of hoops. It also means everything runs slower because hardware
that was designed to be used as a single computer is being asked to
do the work of two or more. With a Mac these issues simply go away.
Under the hood, a Mac works basically the same as the servers I
write code for. This allows me to do what is called "Native
Development". No more jumping through hoops. No more forcing
hardware to pull multiple-duty. Take this along with the
improvements Apple made to the Mac's operating system since 2001
(which is when Windows XP was released) and I'd guess I'm 25-30%
more efficient on a Mac. It's good to be back.
