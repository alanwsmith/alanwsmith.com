title: Get The URLs and Names For Open Safari Tabs With AppleScript

Paste this into the Script Editor app and run it as AppleScript to get the title and URL for all your open tabs in safari. It uses `~~~` as a separator. Using an actual tab character might work, but your milage may vary. (Commas are ill advised since they are a valid URL character)


```applescript
tell application "Safari"	set tabList to ""	set numberOfWindows to count (every window where visible is true)	repeat with windowNumber from 1 to numberOfWindows		set numberOfTabs to number of tabs in window windowNumber		repeat with tabNumber from 1 to numberOfTabs			set tabName to name of tab tabNumber of window windowNumber			set tabURL to URL of tab tabNumber of window windowNumber as string			set tabList to tabList & tabName & "~~~" & tabURL & linefeed as string		end repeat	end repeatend tellreturn tabList```

This is what I used to capture my browsing history each day while I was using Safari. Chrome is gonna take some more work.

I found the core of this script on another site, but I'm not sure where. If I find it, I'll update this with a link.
