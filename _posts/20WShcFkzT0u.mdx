title: An Event Apart 2013 (San Francisco) Links
type: post
---

The San Francisco instance of the [An Event Apart 2013](http://aneventapart.com/) conference is in the books. An overwhelming amount of great, up-to-the-minute information on web design and development was shared. This post contains the links I compiled for future reference. Since an oft repeated theme of the conference is that we should all make an effort to share knowledge, I'm posting them here for posterities sake.

[*Note to attendees: Yes. About 95% of the conference was focused on responsive design. No. This site is not responsive. Someday, I'll fix that. But if I waited until that happened, I'd never get anything posted.*]

- [A Dao of Web Design · An A List Apart Article](http://alistapart.com/article/dao)<br />Web designers often bemoan the malleable nature of the web, which seems to defy our efforts at strict control over layout and typography. But maybe the problem is not the web. Maybe the problem is us. John Allsopp looks at web design through the prism of the Tao Te Ching, and decides that designers should let the web be the web.

Craig Mod (Flipboard, Art Space Tokyo) addresses these questions and presents the initial release of Bibliotype, an HTML baseline typography library for tablet reading.

Rather than being seen as a tedious chore whose demise will be celebrated, hinting might actually provide the essentials for truly responsive design, and vastly expand the possibilities of digital typography for designers, publishers, and readers.

The Globeâs weekday circulation, which includes print readership and digital subscriptions, was 245,572 during the six-month period ended in March â its highest since 2009 and 8.9 percent higher than figures for the same period a year earlier. Sunday circulation rose 4.6 percent to 382,452.  It was the third straight period of gains, after circulation fell in every reporting period from 2004 to 2011. The increases helped make the Globe the 24th highest among paid circulation papers in the country, a year after it had fallen out of the top 25.

But what about larger screens? While we commonly use liquid design for smaller breakpoints, allowing our content to expand and contract as needed, few of us consider what happens beyond a maximum width of 960 pixels or so—which can leave a heap of unused pixels on a contemporary desktop display. Mike Pick explores how to use negative space, scale, density, and layout devices such as grids, modules, and columns to break through the 1024-pixel layout barrier.
