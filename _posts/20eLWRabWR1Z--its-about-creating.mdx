I'm pretty much the only person at work who does what I do in terms
of technology. To the point that I've been told (several times) not
to build things because if I ever leave no one there would know how
to fix something if it broke. A couple of times I've responded with
"What makes you think my stuff is ever going to break?" just to see
the reaction which basically amounted to: Uhhhhhhhhh..... (And no,
I'm not that arrogant, as time marches on, things hard drive fail,
things get updated or changed, etc... and basically everything
gives up the ghost at some point. I've been doing a lot of coding
work over the past week and have built some really nice tools. One
of the things about being the only one who does this type of work
though is there is no one around to appreciate it. I'm happy with
myself as I realized (again) that this basically doesn't bother me
at all. Sure it's nice to hear compliments from time to time, but
for me, it really is the process of creation that has the reward.
