Luminous Landscape just posted an article that also talks about the
convergence of still and video cameras
([link](http://www.luminous-landscape.com/essays/red-raw.shtml)). A
friend in the video industry showed me the
[Red](http://www.red.com/) website a while ago. I don't know
anything about shooting video, but from a pure technolust point of
view I would love to own one of those cameras.
