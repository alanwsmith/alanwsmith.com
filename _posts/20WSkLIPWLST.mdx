Example that needs to be refined:

```sql
-- Get number of files songs appear in the playlists
SELECT songs.displayTitle, songs.idString, playlistSongs.songPrimaryKey, count(*) as countOfSongs 
FROM playlistSongs, songs 
WHERE songs.primaryKey = playlistSongs.songPrimaryKey
GROUP BY songPrimaryKey ORDER BY countOfSongs DESC, displayTitle DESC;
```
