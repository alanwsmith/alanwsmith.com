title: Solar panels with holograms
---

I think solar energy makes an incredible amount of sense. The
prices aren't there yet, but they are getting closer. Technology
Review has a peice up about a company that is starting production
of
[Holographic Solar panels](http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=16736&ch=biztech).
I haven't figured out yet what a breaking price point is for me,
but it's getting closer.
