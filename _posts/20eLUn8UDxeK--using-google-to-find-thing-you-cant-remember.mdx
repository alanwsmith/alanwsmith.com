title: Using Google to Find Thing You Cant Remember
---

Justin sent me a link today about the announcement of the new
[Lego Mindstorms NXT](http://www.lego.com/eng/info/default.asp?page=pressdetail&contentid=17278&countrycode=2057&yearcode=&archive=false).
That's right, soon you too will be able to build your own
wirelessly controlled lego robot. I was trying to remember the name
of an 80s movie where little robots went around killing people and
causing general havoc. Couldn't remember the name of it, but I
remembered there were spider like robots and some type of heat
seeking bullets in it. Turning to google, I just typed in "robot
spider movie heat seaking bullet". The first link
[from the results](http://www.google.com/search?hs=Kvv&hl=en&lr=&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&q=robot+spider+movie+heat+seaking+bullet&btnG=Search),
had the name I was looking for. The Internet is cool.
