An article at [arxivblog.com](http://arxivblog.com/) discusses how
[scientists are going over their calculations](http://arxivblog.com/?p=1136)
for the
[Large Hadron Collider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider)
to make sure it isn't going to destroy the planet. Some of them now
think that it could tiny create black holes that hang around for a
few seconds or minutes. Latest results: the black holes will
\*probably\* decay faster than they grow. Check in with
[http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/](http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/)
to see if the world has been destroyed. (found via
[Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/))
