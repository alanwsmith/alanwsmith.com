title: Infringement In Sound Clouds Terms
---

Some derivative of the word "infringe" occurs 29 times in the Sound Cloud Terms of Use.

I'd be interested to hear stats on the amount of stuff they find that infringes. And I'd be more interested to hear about the number of cases where a third party permits the infringing material to stay up.
