title: Tune up
---

Just took my little car into the shop to get the timing belt
changed and a good tune up done. My last timing belt broke at
around 80,000 miles. So, I figure since I'm at 165,000 it's about
time again. The little camry is purring like a kitten now. I'm so
impressed with the enginering of that car, and I love the fact that
it was designed for longevity instead of obsolessense. Hopefully
I'm not jinxing myself here, but the only thing I've really done to
it is change the oil and replace the timing belt the first time it
broke. Oh yeah. and I've been thru a lot of tires. Now, all I need
to do is figure out if I want to upgrade the stero and speakers
again.....
