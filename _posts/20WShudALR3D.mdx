Vim's `:tabedit` command seems long considering how often it's used. Applying logic from [this StackOverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7515418/102401) produces this customization:

```bash{numberLines: true}
cnoreabbrev <expr> te getcmdtype() == ":" && getcmdline() == 'te' ? 'tabedit' : 'te'
```

It defines a `:te` shortcut which expands to `:tabedit`. Throw it in `~/.vimrc` and save five characters for every tab open.

_It's worth pointing out that [this accepted StackOverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/6638381/102401) provides a dangerous alternative. It recommends `ca` (aka `cabbrev`). For example, `ca te tabedit`. The gotcha hidden in this approach is that it expands across the command. Trying to run `:!ls /tmp/te/` will be altered to `:!ls /tmp/tabedit/`. Not so good._

_And, yes, I [added an answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/30599815/102401) to help out there too._
