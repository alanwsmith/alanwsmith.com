I'm just catching up on some shows and finally watched the first two episodes of "[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles](http://www.fox.com/terminator/)".

They were pretty awesome. 

I was afraid it would be like the remake of Bionic Woman which left me pretty unimpressed after a few episodes. Good news, that doesn't seem to be the case.

[Summer Glau](http://www.fox.com/terminator/bios/summer.htm) is in it as well. I always love seeing folks from Firefly back in the mix. 

So far, the show looks pretty good. With luck, it'll stay good and Fox won't kill it.

Update: November 2021

The show lasted 2 seasons (31 episodes)
