I've seen a couple things about this idea recently and like the
basic idea though it's perhaps a bit extreme for me:
[The Compact](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/thecompact/). Here's a
[USA TODAY article](http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-03-22-simple-life_x.htm)
that I saw from yesterday that brought it back to the forefront of
my mind. End of the first graph pretty much spells out the entire
idea: Buy nothing new except food, medicine and toiletries for six
months. I'm really not that big of a consumer and when I am buying
something I generally like to try to find a used whatever it is
first. Camera lenses are a good example. I end up buying books more
often than I like becuase my local library branch is pretty small
doesn't have a lot of the stuff I'm interested in. Since so much of
what I do and enjoy revolves around "technology" now days a lot of
my purchases end up being brand new. Still, I like the fact that
these folks are thinking this way.
