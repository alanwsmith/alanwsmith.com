Two web tools that can help things out:

[Fiddler](http://www.fiddlertool.com/) - a web debugging proxy for
Windows. It's one of the Microsoft "PowerToys". You can read more
about it
[here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb250446(VS.85).aspx).

[I.E. Developer Toolbar](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=e59c3964-672d-4511-bb3e-2d5e1db91038&displaylang=en)
- adds developer functions to I.E.

I haven't had a chance to check these out yet, but both look very
useful if you do web development and need to see how things go on a
windows box.
