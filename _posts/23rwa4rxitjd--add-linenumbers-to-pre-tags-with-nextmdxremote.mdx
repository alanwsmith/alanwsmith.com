title: Add line-numbers to pre tags with next-mdx-remote
---


This is how I got line numbers working with Prism




```jsx
<MDXRemote
    {...source}
    components={{
        pre: (props) => (
            <pre className="line-numbers">{props.children}</pre>
        ),
    }}
/>
```

This adds the className to all the pre tags. That's fine in this case. Just something to be aware of. 

According to [this](https://mdxjs.com/table-of-components/), there's no way to send extra data down in a code fence besides the language. If you want to do more, you'll need to make a new component
