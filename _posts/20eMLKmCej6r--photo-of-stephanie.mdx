title: Photo of Stephanie

Did another photo workshop a few weeks ago. Just now getting to the edit stage. Here's one of the first ones of a model named Stephanie.

I really need to get back into using photoshop. Touch ups, contrast adjustment and color ballance are taking me forever. If I do much more of this stuff, I'm going to have to actually color balance my monitor too. 

Right now, I struggle to keep from just saying to hell with it and converting everything to black and white or a sepia tone.
