title: Scanning film
---

I'm scanning in some old film negs that I want to have printed. I
had forgotten exactly how time consuming it used to be to get a
digital version of an image. And this is film that is already
developed. Wild to think that with a tethered (or wireless)
connection today, you can be editing in image in Photoshop about as
quickly as you can put the camera down after taking a shot. I have
some nostalgia for the darkroom days of film, but not really any at
all from that middle time period when I was shooting film but doing
edit work digitally and had to transfer the analog to digital
myself. (There is a faint, faint, faint smell of fix on a few of my
old black and white negs. That smell brings a flood of great
memories.)
